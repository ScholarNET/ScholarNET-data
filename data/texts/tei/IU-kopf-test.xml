          <head><persName>Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm b. ʿAlī</persName></head>
          <p> was our Shaykh, the chief of ministers, the learned and worthy Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd
            al-Raḥīm b. ʿAlī b. Ḥāmid, known as al-Dakhwār. He was — may Allāh have mercy upon him —
            unique among his generation, peerless in his time, the most learned scholar of his
            epoch, the apogee of medical skill and knowledge, both general and specialized. No one
            matched him in diligence or learning. He tired himself out with work, straining his mind
            in order to gain knowledge, until he surpassed all contemporary physicians and won more
            remuneration and honor from kings than any doctor had ever before. He was born in
            Damascus and brought up there by his father, ʿAlī b. Ḥāmid, a famous oculist, whose
            other <pb n="902" ed="kopf"/> son, Ḥāmid b. ʿAlī, took up the same profession. At first,
            Muhadhdhab al-Dīn was also an oculist, but at the same time he worked as a copyist. His
            calligraphy was outstanding. He transcribed many books, of which I have seen a hundred
            or more, dealing with medicine and other sciences. He worked for the al-Shaykh Tāj al-Dīn
            al-Kindī Abū al-Yaman, but constantly endeavored to increase his knowledge by reading
            and memorizing — a habit he kept up until old age.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of his medical career, he was introduced to al-Makī's teachings by
            the Shaīkh Radī al-Dīn al-Rahbī — may Allāh have mercy upon him — and then became a
            close associate of Mūwafaq al-Dīn b. al-Mutrān, for whom he worked and from whom he
            learnt the art of medicine. He continued to seek out his company and study his books
            until he became expert. Afterwards Fakhr al-Dīn al-Mardīnī, who came to Damascus in the
            year 579/1189, instructed him to part of Ibn Sīnā's ʿQānūn," which Fakhr al-Dīn knew and
            comprehended thoroughly.</p>
          <p>Muhadhdhab al-Dīn worked as a physician to al-Malik al-ʿAdil Abū Bakr b. Ayyūb. This
            was because at the beginning of his career he was interested in eye diseases and wished
            to gain practice in their treatment. He worked as an oculist in <pb ed="mueller-1884" edRef="https://github.com/usaybia/usaybia-data/blob/master/data/texts/tei/IU-sample.xml" n="2.240"/>the Great Hospital
            established by al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn Maḥmūd b. Zankī. Later, when he worked with
            al-Mutrān and had become noted for his medical skill, Safī al-Dīn b. Shakr, the vizier
            of al-Malik al-ʿAdil b. Ayyūb, granted him an allowance, by means of which he was able to
            practice work and at the same time increase his knowledge and proficiency. </p>

          <p> He was tireless in the service of the vizier, and the latter, knowing Muhadhadhab's
            professional merits, preferred him to all others. In the month of Shawwal, 604/1207,
            al-Malik al-ʿĀdil said to Ibn Shakr: "We want another doctor besides Muwaffaq al-Dīn
            ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz for attending the troops. This work is not congenial to <pb n="903"
              ed="kopf"/> ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz, so do as he requests." Said b. Shakr: "We have here an
            excellent physician, named Muhadhdhab al-Dakhwār, who is fit for our master's service."
            Then he ordered him to comply. When Muhadhdhab al-Dīn appeared before the vizier, the
            latter said to him: "I have recommended you to the Sultan, and you are paid a month for
            your services." But Muhadhdhab al-Dīn said: "My lord: The Doctor Muwaffaq al-Dīn ʿAbd
            al-ʿAzīz earns about a hundred dinars monthly.</p>

          <p>I know my status, and I will not serve without a decent wage. Then he took leave of the
            vizier and refused the post. But his companions made him regret his refusal, his lost
            chance to be engaged by the vizier. For his salary at the hospital was very low.</p>
          <p>About that time, Muwaffaq ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz was stricken with severe colitis, which grew
            worse and eventually caused his death. When the news of his passing reached al-Malik
            al-ʿAdil, the latter said to the vizier: "You once recommended to us a doctor by the
            name of Muhadhdhab. Appoint him in place of Muwaffad ʿAbd al-ʿAziz. "So Muhadhdhab got
            all his posts, and he remained in the service of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil from then on. He rose
            steadily in al-Malik al-ʿĀdil's esteem, and his status was enhanced, until he became his
            companion, associate and adviser. At the beginning of his service, al-Malik put his
            knowledge to some unusual tests, and the results strengthened his opinion of him and his
            reliance upon him.</p>
          <p>About that time, al-Malik al-ʿĀdil fell ill. He was attended by the best doctors.
            Muhadhdhab advised bloodletting but the other physicians present did not agree. He said:
            "By Allāh! If we let blood from him, he will bleed without our being able to staunch
            it." But they were still obstinate. Very soon the Sultan began to bleed heavily. When he
            was well again, he realized that Muhadhdhab outshone all the others. <pb n="904"
              ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>Another story has it that one day, when he was standing at the palace gate with some
            court physicians, a servant came out with a vial containing the urine of one of the
            concubines and reported that she was in pain. When the doctors had inspected the vial,
            they ventured a diagnosis. But Muhadhdhab examined it closely and said: "The pain she
            complains of does not cause this color," suspecting it to be induced by Lawsonia with
            which she had anointed herself. The servant told him that his finding was correct,
            marvelled at him and reported the incident to al-Malik al-ʿĀdil; this increased the
            latter's confidence in Muhadhdhab.</p>
          <p>One of the best anecdotes about Shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn, and one that illustrates his
            savoir-faire and loyalty, is the following which was told my by my father. Once,
            al-Malik al-ʿĀdil was very angry with the chief judge, Muhyī al-Dīn b. Zakī al-Dīn, of
            Damascus. He ordered him to be detained in the fortress, demanded from him the sum of
            10,000 Egyptian dinars and pressed for payment. Muhyī al-Dīn was to remain in prison
            until the amount was settled. He paid some of the money, but was unable to raise the
            balance. Al-Malik al-ʿĀdil was inexorable, saying: "He must pay the rest, otherwise I
            shall deal very harshly with him." The judge was in dire straits. He sold all his
            possessions — his household effects, and <pb ed="mueller-1884" edRef="https://github.com/usaybia/usaybia-data/blob/master/data/texts/tei/IU-sample.xml" n="2.241"/> even his books. Then he wrote letters to the
            Sultan, using the good offices of many leading personalities, such as al-Shamīs, the
            court teacher, and Shams al-Khawās the vizier, asking for the remission of part of the
            amount or to be allowed to pay in installments. But the Sultan remained adamant, and as
            a result, the judge was so worried that he hardly ate or slept and thus almost killed
            himself. At this point, his old friend Muhadhdhab al-Dīn paid him a visit. The judge
            told Muhadhdhab al-Dīn his troubles, begging him to do what he could. After some
            consideration, al-Muhadhdhab said: "I shall do something for you. I hope that, God
            willing, it will be of use." Then he departed. <pb n="905" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>Serīat al-Malik al-ʿAdil, the mother of al-Malīk al-Sālih b. al-Malīk, was unwell at
            that time. She was of Turkish origin, an intelligent, pious and good woman, very kind
            and generous. When the Doctor Muhadhdhab al-Dīn came to see her in the harem, he
            acquainted her with the case of the judge, his troubles and the unjust treatment meted
            out to him — i.e., that he was being asked to do the impossible — and requested that she
            intervene: perhaps the Sultan could show mercy to him and remit part of the debt or let
            him pay it in installments. The chief eunuch supported Muhadhdhab request. But Seriat
            said: "How can I do anything for the judge, or even mention him to the Sultan? I cannot,
            because he will ask: 'What makes you speak about the judge, and how is it that you know
            him?' If we were, say, a doctor who visits us from time to time, or a merchant who sells
            us cloth, it would be possible for me to talk and intervene; but as it is, I can do
            nothing." When Muhadhdhab heard this, he said: "My lady! You have an only son, whom you
            wish happiness and a long life. Now, you can obtain this for him from Allāh by doing
            something without actually intervening with the Sultan at all." Said she: "And what is
            that?" Said he: "When the Sultan and you sleep together, tell him you have dreamt that
            the judge is being treated unjustly"; and he told her what to say. She thereupon said,
            "It can be done."</p>
          <p>One night, when she was well again and the Sultan was sleeping with her, as the night
            was ending, she pretended to be frightened, clutched at her heart and kept shivering and
            crying. The Sultan, who loved her dearly, noticed it and said: "What is the matter with
            you?" But she did not reply. He then ordered some apple juice to be brought and had her
            drink some, sprinkled her face with rose water and said: "Will you not tell me what has
            happened to you, why you are so upset?" She said: "O Master, I have had a dream which
            almost frightened to death. I dreamt that it was Doomsday and saw a large crowd of <pb
              n="906" ed="kopf"/> people. In one place, where there was a great fire, people were
            saying: "This had been prepared for al-Malīk al-ʿĀdil because of the injustice he did to
            the judge." Then she said: "Have you ever done anything to the judge?" And he, who did
            not doubt her story, became troubled, rose early, called his servants and said to them:
            "Go to the judge and make him happy: give him my regards, ask him to forgive me and tell
            him that all he has paid will be returned to him. As for me, I will ask nothing of him."
            So they went to him. The judge was very pleased with their announcement, blessed the
            Sultan and forgave him. In the same morning the Sultan ordered that he be given a suit
            of clothes and a mule. He restored him to his office and ordered that all the books and
            other possessions he had sold be redeemed from the purchasers for the same amount as
            they had paid. Thus relief was brought to the judge after anguish, by minimum effort and
            the subtlest of tactics.</p>
          <p>In the year 610/1213, when he was in the east, al-Malīk al-ʿĀdil became very ill, and
            Muhadhdhab al-Dīn treated him until he was cured. During that illness, the king paid the
            physician 7,000 Egyptian dinars. In addition, the king's children, some eastern kings
            and others sent him gold, suits of clothes, mule carts, gold neckbands and other
            items.</p>
          <p>A similar event occurred in the year <pb ed="mueller-1884" n="2.242"> </pb> 612/1215, when al-Malīk al-Ādil went to Egypt and
            stayed in Cairo. At that time, a dreadful cholera epidemic killed many people. Among
            those stricken was al-Malīk al-Kāmil b. al-Maīlk al-ʿĀdil, who was the Governor of
            Egypt. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn treated him most solicitously until he became well again. This
            time, Muhadhdhab al-Dīn received 12,000 dinars' worth of gold, besides many suits of
            clothes and other splendid gifts, including fourteen mules carrying golden rings and a
            great deal of satin and other kinds of cloth. <pb n="907" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>About that time, the Sultan appointed Muhadhdhab al-Dīn chief physician of Egypt and
            Syria. I was then with my father, who was also in the service of al-Malīk al-ʿĀdil.
            Muhadhdhab al-Dīn was in charge of ophthalmological matters; it was he who decided who
            was qualified to treat eye diseases.</p>
          <p>In the year 614/1217, having learnt of Christian maneuvers near the coast, al-Malik
            al-ʿĀdil went to Syria and stayed at Marj al-Sughr. While he was in a place called
            Manzilat al-Ālekīn, he fell ill and died, may Allāh have mercy upon him. He died in the
            second hour of Friday, the 7th day of Jumādā al-Ākhira, in the year 615/1218.</p>
          <p>When al-Malik al-Muʿazam had established his rule over Syria, he wished to employ
            several of those who had served his father, al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, among them the physician
            Rashīd al-Dīn b. al-Surī, who refused. As for Muhadhdhab al-Dīn, he gave him a salary
            and ordered him to live in Damascus, where he was to treat patients at the Great
            Hospital established by al-Malik al-ʿAdil Nūr al-Dīn b. Zankī.</p>
          <p>When Muhadhdhab al-Dīn was in Damascus, he began to teach medicine, and many of the
            best physicians joined him, besides others that studied under him. I, too, stayed in
            Damascus to learn from him (but I had first worked under him at the military camp where
            my father and he served the great Sultan). I would visit him as one of a group of
            students, and I began to study Galen. He was well-versed in the works of this author and
            others. He admired Galen very much, and whenever someone mentioned anything he had
            written concerning diseases and their therapy or the fundamentals of the medical
            science, he would say: "That is medicine."</p>

          <p>He was quick-witted, a clear thinker and a good conversationalist. I accompanied him on
            his rounds at the hospital, thus gaining personal experience. At that time, his
            associate was the eminent physician ʿAmrān. Later, their collaboration became less
