          <p> was a Christian with a profound knowledge of medicine and an experience in its
            practice. Sabur 'with the wings' built him a church in his town. It was also said that
            it was built for him by Bahram Gur. He wrote a Compendium of Medicine.</p>

          <p> It was said that he was learned in medicine and known for it, distinguished in his
            times and versed in the sciences of the Persians and the Indians; that he was the one
            who brought the book, "Kalila wa-Dimna" from India to Anushiʿrwan b. Qubadhin Fairuz,
            the Persian king, and translated it for him from the Indian language to the Persian,
            then in the Islamic era ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Muqaffaʿ the preacher translated it from
            Persian into Arabic. This book is reputed y conducive to good morals and behavior and
            does not have an equal. ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Muqaffaʿ the preacher was also a Persian, the
            scribe of Abū Jaʿfar al-Mansūr. He also translated Aristotle: "Categories," "De
            Interpretatione," the "Book of Analytics," and also the introduction to the works on
            logic known as "Isagugi Furfurius al-Sūrī." His style was easy and readable. He also
            wrote some original works, among which are the epistle on literature and politics and
            the epistle known as "al-Yatīmah," on obedience to the ruler.  <pb n="532" ed="kopf"

          <p> The ruler Jamal al-Dīn b. al-Qiftī wrote in his book that this Raban al-Tabarī was a
            Jewish physician and astronomer, born in Tabaristān. Distinguished in medicine,
            outstanding in geometry and the exact sciences, he translated scientific works. His
            father ʿAlī b. Raban was a famous physician, who moved from Tabaristān to Irāq and
            settled in Samarra. He was an advanced scholar of Judaism. Al-Raban, al-Rabīn, al-Rāb —
            all these are names for those well-versed in the knowledge of the Jewish law.</p>
          <p>Abū Maʿshar was asked concerning the casting of shadows. He discoursed at length until
            finally he said: "The translators of the version of al-Majistī taken from the Greek did
            not mention the matter of casting shadows, which is not to be found except in the
            version translated by Raban al-Tabarī the physician. In the old versions the matter of
            Ptolemy's casting shadows is not mentioned, neither did Thābit, nor Hunayn al-Qalawsī
            nor al-Kindī nor any other of those great translators know about it, including the sons
            of Nawbakht."</p>

            was converted to Islam by al-Muʿtasim and became his favorite. Al-Mutawakkil took him to
            be one of his companions. He was held in high esteem as a man of letters and was
            al-Rāzī's teacher in medicine. He was born and bred in Tabaristān. One of his saying is:

          <head>AL-RĀZĪ (Rhazes)</head>
          <head><persName>Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. Zakariyyā al-Rāzī.</persName></head>
          <p> Born and raised in al-Ray, when he was in his thirties he traveled to Baghdād, where
            he stayed for a while. From his youth he had a penchant for the rational, sciences and
            devoted himself to these and to literature; he also wrote poetry.</p>
          <p>Medicine he studied when he was already adult, his teacher being ʿAlī b. Raban
            al-Tabarī.</p>
          <p>Abū Saʿīd the ascetic scholar said in his book on hospitals that the reason for his
            taking up medicine was the following. When he came to Baghdād he visited the ʿAdudi
            Hospital, and it so happened that he met an old man there who was the hospital
            pharmacist. He asked him about drugs and who was the first to discover them. The other
            answered: "The first known drug was the 'living world,' because of Ablanius the
            descendant of Asclepius. This Ablanius had an acute swelling on his arm, which was very
            painful. He desired to go to the riverbank, and ordered his servants to take him. A
            certain plant was growing there, and he put his arm on it. This cooled it and the pain
            was relieved; he left his arm there for a long time, and on the morrow did the same,
            until he was cured. People saw how fast he had recovered and were informed of that plant
            which had effected the cure, they called the plant 'the life of the world.'" Ionynes
            abbreviated it to the 'living world.' When al-Rāzī heard this he was amazed. He came
            back to that hospital and saw a boy born with one head and two faces. Asking the
            physicians for the reason, he was informed accordingly and greatly astonished. Thus he
              <pb n="534" ed="kopf"/> continued to ask one thing after the other, the answers were
            given, and he stored them up in his heart until he decided to learn the profession, in
            which he became the Arab Galen.</p>
          <p>This is Abū Saʿīd's version. Others say that al-Rāzī was among those who decided to
            build the ʿAdudi Hospital and that ʿAdud al-Dawlah had consulted him concerning a
            suitable site. Al-Rāzī ordered a slave to hand a piece of meat in each quarter of
            Baghdād and then watched to see which one did not spoil and rot quickly. In that quarter
            he suggested that the hospital be built, and indeed it was.</p>
          <p>Kamal al-Dīn Abū al-Qāsim b. Abū Turāb al-Baghdādī the scribe told me the following:
            "When he built the hospital which is called after him, ʿAdud al-Dawlah, intended to
            employ there a group of the best physicians, and accordingly asked for a list of the
            famous physicians who were then living in Baghdād and its environs. More than a hundred
            names were given and he chose about fifty from them, taking into account their
            circumstances and their medical skill. Al-Rāzī was among them. Then he chose ten from
            the fifty, and al-Rāzī was among these. At last he chose three out of the ten, and again
            al-Rāzī was one of them. He then compared the three and found al-Rāzī to be the best, so
            he put him in charge of the hospital."</p>
          <p>Ibn Abū Usaybiʿah continues: The truth emerged as the following. Al-Rāzī was older then
            ʿAdud al-Dawlah b. Buwayhi, and he had frequented the hospital before its restoration by
            ʿAdud al-Dawlah; for he wrote a book describing the hospital and the conditions of the
            patients he found there.</p>
          <p>ʿUbayd Allāh b. Jibrā´īl told the author that when ʿAdud al-Dawlah built the new
            hospital at the end of the bridge on the west side of Baghdād he brought in physicians
            from all around. He ordered twenty-four to be chosen from them, and among those selected
            was Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. Ibrāhīm b. Baks, a blind man who used to teach medicine there.
            Also chosen were Abū al-Ḥasan b. Kashkarāyā, known as the disciple of Sunān, Abū Yaʿqub
            al-Ahwāzī, Abū ʿĪsā Baqiyyah, al-Quss al-Rūmī, <pb n="535" ed="kopf"/> the sons of
            Hasnun, and a group of physicists. ʿUbayd Allāh continues: "My father Jibrā'īl had come
            from Shīrāz with ʿAdud al-Dawlah and was classified among the physicists of the hospital
            and as one of the specialists. The hospital also had some distinguished oculists, such
            as Abū Nasr b. al-Dahlī, surgeons, like Abū al-Khayr and Abū al-Ḥasan b. Tuffāh, and his
            group, and bone-setters, including Abū al-Salt."</p>
          <p>Sulaymān b. Hassān said that al-Rāzī was in charge of the hospital in al-Ray a long
            time before he was employed at the ʿAdudi Hospital. He has it that al-Rāzī started out
            as a lute-player and only later turned to medicine and philosophy, in which he
            excelled.</p>
          <p>The judge Sāʿid in his book "The History of the Nations" says that al-Rāzī did not go
            deeply into theology and could not grasp its ultimate significance. This warped his
            mind, and he adopted hateful opinions and followed wicked paths. He censured people whom
            he could not understand and whose ways he could not learn.</p>
          <p>Muḥammad b. Isḥāq al-Nadīm, known as Abū al-Faraj Abū Yaʿqub, wrote in his "Fihrist"
            that al-Rāzī was traveling in the country when he struck up a warm friendship with
            Mansūr b. Ismāʿīl, for whom he wrote the Mansūrī book. Muḥammad b. al-Ḥasan al-Warrāq
            told Abū al-Faraj that a very old man from al-Ray, whom he had asked about al-Rāzī, told
            him that the latter was a shaykh with a very large head who used to sit in his council
            with his disciples opposite him, behind them their disciples and behind them theirs.
            When a man came he would tell his problem to the first ones he met. If they could solve
            it well and good — if not, they would pass it on to the others: if they knew, so much
            the better, but if not, al-Rāzī would discuss it. He was noble and virtuous, pure of
            heart and kind to the poor and sick, giving generous donations and treating them.</p>
          <p>Abū Yaʿqūb continues: "Whenever I visited him, I never saw him leaving the stairs [?]
            and the books he was correcting for better or worse. His sight was affected by the
            amount of broad beans he used to eat until <pb n="536" ed="kopf"/> he became blind in
            his last years. He used to say that he studied philosophy under al-Balkhī. This
            al-Balkhī was a man from Balkh who traveled around the world, profoundly knowledgeable
            in philosophy and the sciences of the ancients. It is said that al-Rāzī used his name as
            a pen-name. Ibn al-Nadīm saw a great deal of material on many sciences written in his
            hand, canvasses and notebooks of which he did not compile a whole book for publication;
            however, people say that his books were available in Khurasan.</p>
          <p>"Al-Rāzī had a contemporary called Shahfd b. al-Ḥusayn, known as Abū al-Ḥasan, who
            followed his path of philosophy in the sciences and wrote copiously. He and al-Rāzī had
            arguments in which each contradicted the other."</p>
          <p>Ibn Abū Usaybiʿah continues: al-Rāzī was wise, skilled and benevolent to the sick,
            endeavoring to do his utmost for them. He persevered in his research into the unknown in
            medicine and in his quest of its truths and secrets. He applied the same zeal in the
            other sciences too, to the point where most of the time he had no interest in anything
            but the study of the problems raised by the distinguished scholars in their works. I
            found a mention by him in one of his books that he had a noble friend who used to spend
            the nights with him reading Hippocrates and Galen.</p>
          <p>There are many stories told about al-Rāzī with various morals concerning his skill in
            medicine and his genius in the treatment of the sick, the recognition of their maladies
            from given information and his prescriptions and drugs, which few physicians knew about.
            He himself tells many stories in this connection, drawn from his experience. A number of
            them he mentioned in a special chapter of his book "Al-Hāwī" [the Collection] and in his
            "Secrets of Medicine."</p>
          <p>The judge Abū ʿAlī al-Muhsin b. Abū Jahm al-Tanūkhī, in his book "The Relief Following
            Suffering," mentions the following story to exemplify his miraculous prescriptions and
            prognoses. It is told in <pb n="537" ed="kopf"/> the name of Muḥammad b. ʿAlī b.
            al-Khalāl al-Basrī Abū al-Ḥusayn, a truthful judge, who heard it from a trustworthy
            physician. A youth from Baghdād arrived at al-Ray emitting blood. It had happened while
            he was on his way, and he was asking for Abū Bakr al-Rāzī, the physician celebrated for
            his skill, the author of famous books. He showed the latter the hemorrhage and told his
            story. Al-Rāzī took his pulse, examined his urine and then asked him to describe his
            condition from its onset. He could not detect any sign of phthisis or ulcer and was at a
            loss to diagnose the illness, so he asked for time to think the matter over. The patient
            was overcome by pain and exclaimed: "I give up hope if this skillful physician does not
            know my malady! " The bleeding increased, and then it occurred to al-Rāzī to return and
            ask him about the water he had drunk on his way. He was informed that the man had drunk
            from swamps and cisterns. The physician, with his trained mind and sharp intellect, then
            hit upon the idea that there had been leech in the water which had entered his stomach
            and was now causing the bleeding. He said to the youth: "Tomorrow I shall come and treat
            you, and I will not leave you until you are cured. Only on one condition, that you will
            order your servants to obey me in whatever I tell them to do." The patient having
            agreed, al-Rāzī went and got two big tubs full of green moss, which he brought with him
            on the morrow and showed to the youth, ordering him to swallow their entire contents.
            The patient swallowed a little and then stopped. The physician ordered him to go on, but
            he said he could not. He then told the servants to take him and lay him on his back,
            which they did. They opened his mouth, and al-Rāzī forced the moss into his throat,
            pushing it hard and ordered him to swallow it, willy nilly, even threatening him with a
            beating, until he swallowed all of one of those tubs, while crying for help — but
            nothing could stop al-Rāzī. He then said: "This very moment I shall vomit it all!" But
            al-Rāzī only continued to press the moss into his mouth, until the patient was overcome
            by the urge and vomited.  <pb n="538" ed="kopf"/>Al-Rāzī examined the vomit and indeed
            found a leech in it. By its nature it started to leave its place and turn to gnaw on the
            moss when it felt its presence; the patient ejected it, together with the moss and arose
            cured.</p>
          <p>Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. ʿAbd Allāh b. Muḥammad al-Rāzī, known as Ibn Hamdūn, told in the
            name of Abū Bakr Aḥmad b. ʿAlī al-Rāzī the jurist, who heard it from Abū Bakr b. Qārin
            al-Rāzī the skillful physician, that the famous al-Rāzī knew many sciences better than
            the Hadith, but the people used to tell and write traditions in his name which I had
            never heard from him. The judge from Tanūkh notes that in spite of his long acquaintance
            with al-Rāzī, he had never heard this story from him.</p>
          <p>Said Ibn Qārim al-Rāzī, who was al-Rāzī's medical student, relates that he heard
            al-Rāzī telling the following story after his return from the Emir of Khurāsān, who had
            called for him and was cured by him of a grave illness. Said al-Rāzī: "On my way I
            passed through Naysābūr Baykām, which is a place midway between Naysābūr and al-Ray. Its
            chief welcomed me, took me to his house and treated me most kindlv. He then asked me to
            examine his son, who had dropsy. He took me into a house which was set aside for him and
            I examined him, but my host did not want him to be cured, so I diverted my conversation
            in front of the patient. When I was left alone with the father, who had asked me whether
            I agreed with him, I confirmed this and threw him into despair of his son's life,
            saying: "Let him do as he likes, for he will not live long!" I then left Khurāsān and
            came back twelve months later. I passed by there and the man welcomed me back. When we
            met I felt a great uneasiness, for I had no doubt as to his son's death, remembering
            that I was the one to announce it, and fearing lest I be a burden upon him. He took me
            into the house and I could not find any sign of the situation, but I was loath to ask
            him about his son and thus renew his sorrow. One day he asked me: 'Do you recognize this
            fellow?' pointing to a youth of good <pb n="539" ed="kopf"/> countenance and health,
            with plentiful blood and vigor, who was standing among the boys serving us. I said I did
            not know him, and he told me it was his son, of whose life I had made him despair. I was
            amazed and asked how he had recovered. He then told that after I had left, the boy
            understood that I had made his father despair of him and said to him: 'Undoubtedly this
            man, who is unique in our times in medicine, made you give up hope for me; now I have a
            request that you do not let these boys (meaning those serving him), who are my friends,
            come here; for when I see them healthy, knowing that I am going to die, my heart is
            assailed by fever which hastens my end. Spare me this, by keeping them away from me, and
            allot to my service that woman, my nurse.' The father fulfilled his request; she was
            given her daily keep, and the boy was given everything he asked for without any
            restraint. One day, when the nurse was given meat cooked in sour milk to eat, she left
            it where the boy could see it, and went back to her duties. She told the father that
            when she came back she saw that his son had eaten most of what was in the bowl, and what
            was left seemed to be spoiled. She asked him what it was, and he exclaimed: 'Don't go
            near the bowl!' and snatched it away, saying: 'I saw a great snake come out, creep
            toward it, and eat from it, then it vomited and its color changed to what you see now. I
            said to myself — I am going to die, and would not like to suffer great pain. When shall
            I have an opportunity like this? — so I ate from the bowl as much as I could, so that I
            would die quickly and find rest. When I could not eat any more I returned to my place,
            and then you came in.' The nurse saw the meat in sour milk on his hands and mouth and
            cried out. He said: 'Do not do anything, but go and bury the bowl with its contents,
            lest somebody eat from it and die, or an animal eat it and bite somebody to death.' She
            did as he said, and then went to the boy's father and told the whole story. He was
            overwhelmed by grief and rushed to his son, whom he found asleep. He ordered him <pb
              n="540" ed="kopf"/> to be left undisturbed until they could find out what to do. He
            woke up at the end of the day, having sweated profusely, and asked for the pot. He
            rushed to it and his stomach evacuated fiercely. That night and the following day he
            evacuated more than a hundred times, and their despair for him deepened. After many days
            had passed, he ate a little, and then asked for chicks and ate them. His strength
            steadily returned, after being so thin that his belly touched his back. Hope for his
            recovery grew stronger and he was forbidden to mix his food. His strength increased,
            until he came to be as al-Rāzī now witnessed.</p>
          <p>"I was greatly astonished and remarked that the ancients had said that a man afflicted
            with dropsy may be cured by eating the meat of a reptile hundreds of years old. Now if I
            had told the man that that would be his son's cure, he would have thought that I was
            just evading the issue for how can we know how old a reptile is, when we find it and it
            stays silent?!"</p>
          <p>Ibn Abū Usaybiʿah continues: Al-Rāzī has many such personal anecdotes, of which I
            mentioned several in my book "Stories of Physicians about Treating the Sick." Al-Rāzī
            stayed mostly in Persia, his homeland, and that of his family. He served as physician to
            the kings of the Persians and wrote many books there, on medicine and other topics. He
            dedicated his book "al-Mansūri" to al-Mansūr b. Ismāʿīl b. Khāqān the ruler of Khurāsān
            and Transoxania. His "al-Mulukī" was dedicated to ʿAlī the son of the ruler of
            Tabaristān. Al-Rāzī also applied himself to the philosophical sciences and distinguished
            himself in that field. In the beginning he was interested in natural magic and chemistry
            and what pertains to them. He wrote books on all of these subjects. I have copied the
            following from a manuscript by Balmuzaffar b. Muʿarrif: al-Rāzī used to say: "I do not
            consider a man to be a philosopher unless he knows the science of chemistry, for by this
            he has no need to have recourse to the filthiness of people and can stay clear from them
            and their help." <pb n="541" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>A physician told me that al-Rāzī had sold to some people from Byzantium golden ingots,
            which they carried to their country; a few years later they found an alteration in their
            color and so realized that they were spurious. They brought them back and he was
            compelled to take them.</p>
          <p>Another one told me that once al-Rāzī entertained a vizier as his guest and the latter
            heartily enjoyed the food he ate there. He thought about the matter until he bought one
            of the girls who cooked for al-Razī, hoping that she would cook the same for him. When
            she prepared some food, he did not find it as tasty as it was at al-Rāzī's. Having asked
            her about it, she informed him that the food was the same, only the pots at al-Razi's
            were all of gold and silver. He then understood that this explained the taste and that
            al-Rāzī had mastered the science of chemistry. He summoned al-Rāzī and ordered him to
            teach him all he knew about chemistry, but al-Rāzī would not disclose a thing. The other
            envied his knowledge and would have wished to strangle him with a rope.</p>
          <p>Others say that in the beginning al-Rāzī was a moneychanger, a fact that is proved by
            an old manuscript by al-Mansūrī that I have found, the end of which has disappeared and
            the rest mostly torn because of its age. Its introduction runs exactly thus: "The
            compendium of al-Mansūrī, written by Muḥammad b. Zakariyyā the money-changer." The man
            to whom the manuscript belongs informed me that it is in al-Rāzī's own handwriting.
            Al-Rāzī was a contemporary of Isḥāq b. Hunayn and the group of that generation. In his
            last years he became blind of a cataract. It was suggested that he undergo a
            perforation, but he refused to allow this, saying: "I have seen this world to the point
            where I am weary of it."</p>
          <p>Abū al-Khayr al-Ḥasan b. Suwār b. Bābā, who was roughly of the same generation as
            al-Rāzī, said that the latter died in 290/902-3 or 300/912, but he was in doubt about
            the date. I have copied from a <pb n="542" ed="kopf"/> manuscript by BalMuzaffar b.
            Muʿarrif that al-Rāzī died in 320/932. ʿUbayd Allāh b. Jibrā'īl reported that al-Rāzī
            held a high position in al-Ray and the other mountain cities. He lived until he was
            reached by Ibn al-ʿAmīd the master of al-Hāwiʿ al-Sāhib b. Ibād, who arranged the
            publication of his book. For when he arrived at al-Ray, al-Rāzī was already dead, and he
            asked his sister for this book, paying many dinars, until finally she gave him the
            canvasses. He gathered together al-Rāzī's disciples, the physicians of al-Ray, and they
            put the book together, with the result that it came out with all the disorder that is in
            it.</p>
          <p>Among al-Rāzī's sayings are:</p>
          <p>"The truth of medicine is an attainable goal, and the treatment is what is found in
            textbooks, coupled with the experience and opinions of the skilled physician."</p>
          <p>"Excessive reading of the sages' books and the study of their secrets are things
            advantageous to every physician of high standing." </p>
          <p>"Our life is too short to learn the significance of every plant that grows, so learn
            the most famous that you know well, leave aside the irregularities and concentrate on
            those you have experimented with."</p>
          <p>"One who has not studied the natural things, the philosophical sciences and the rules
            of logic, but is inclined to worldly pleasures — his knowledge is to be suspected,
            especially where medicine is concerned."</p>
          <p>"When Galen and Aristotle agree upon something, it is the truth; when they disagree, it
            would be very difficult for us to decide where the truth lies."</p>
          <p>"Maladies with fever are more fatal than cool maladies, because of the swiftness with
            which the fire moves."</p>
          <p>"For recovering from an illness, when they desire some food that might harm them, the
            physician must use deceit in giving that food and changing it to a beneficial quality,
            but he should never forbid them to overcome their desire." <pb n="543" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>"A physician must always be encouraging to his patient about his health and hope for
            it, even when he entertains doubts, for the state of the body follows that of the
            spirits."</p>
          <p>"The physicians who are ignorant and copiers and the young ones who have no experience
            and no knowledge, only desires, are all murderers."</p>
          <p>"The physician must not neglect any question he can put to his patient concerning the
            source of his illness from within or without —then he should judge which is the decisive
            factor."</p>
          <p>"A patient must stick to one reliable physician only, for an error on his part,
            compared to his rightness, would be a trifling one."</p>
          <p>"A patient who consults many physicians causes each one of them to fall into
            error."</p>
          <p>"When a physician concentrates on experience, without analogy and the study of books,
            he is lost."</p>
          <p>"One must not trust the good knowledge of medicine until he comes up against a tough
            problem and tests it."</p>
          <p>"A physician must take the middle road — not turn to the world completely, nor turn
            wholly away from the next; let him be between desire and abstention."</p>

          <p>"The movements of the planets lengthwise and widthwise determine the changes of natures
            and humors."</p>
          <p>"The various conditions obtaining in different countries affect the humors, natures and
            habits and the quality of drugs and foods, so that a second-rate drug becomes
            fourth-rate and vice versa."</p>
          <p>"When a physician is able to treat by diet without recourse to drugs he is a happy
            man."</p>
          <p>"A thing agreed upon by the physicians, approved by analogy, but contradicted by
            experience, let it be your guide, and vice versa."</p>

            al-Rāzī starts with the words: "Said Muḥammad . . . " Amīn al-Dawlah b. al-Tilmīdh has a
            marginal note on this book, saying that it is by al-Rāzī and that the man mentioned by
            al-Rāzī frequently in this book as "Muḥammad" is the physician known as al-Ḥasan, who
            served al-Muqtadir. He was a skillful physician in Baghdād, whose <pb n="551" ed="kopf"

          <p>Ibn Abū Usaybiʿah comments: Only Allāh knows if in fact he composed this book. — It is
            probable that one of the wicked enemies of al-Rāzī wrote it and ascribed it to him. As
            for me, I have never met anybody who saw this book or heard al-Rāzī talking about it.
            For al-Rāzī is too lofty to handle such a subject or to write in such a manner. Even
            some of those who censure him or even brand him an atheist, like ʿAlī b. Ridwān
            al-Misrī, call this book "The Book of al-Rāzī about the Fine Prophets."</p>

          <p> known as Ibn al-Khammār. Bahmam is a Persian expression which is made up of two words
            — Bah, good, and Nām, name — i.e., the name of good. This Abū al-Khayr was a Christian
            whose medical knowledge was broad and sound.</p>
          <p>He was also an expert in the philosophical sciences, which he studied with Yaḥyā b.
            ʿAdī, and the author of many fine works on medicine and other <pb n="559" ed="kopf"/>
            disciplines. He was an adept translator and rendered many books from Syriac into Arabic.
            I have seen some of them in his own script, and found them worthy. Abū al-Khayr was the
            epitome of intelligence and virtue. He was born in Rabī I 331/November 942.</p>
          <p>Abū al-Khattāb Muḥammad b. Muḥammad b. Abū Tālib in his "General Book on Medicine"
            mentioned Abū al-Khayr as still being alive in the year 330/941. In "The Solution to
            al-Rāzī's Doubts about Galen" Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. Ridwān wrote thus: "In our generation
            there lived al-Ḥasan b. Bābā, known as b. al-Khammār, who reached such perfection in
            medicine that he was accepted by Maḥmūd the king of the earth. This King Maḥmūd was
            indeed great, but that person [Abū al-Khayr] was a philosopher of fine reasoning and
            vast knowledge. He knew how to treat scholars and the chiefs of the people, great men
            and kings.  His method was as follows. When somebody who behaved humbly and devotedly
            called him, he went on foot, saying: 'This walking is an atonement for my passing over
            to the people of immorality and tyranny'; but when he was called by the Sultan, he rode
            to him as a king or an important personage, with three hundred Turkish slaves
            accompanying him on fine horses, dressed in splendid attire. He paid his profession its
            due share of humility to the weak and arrogance with the powerful. This was also the way
            of Hippocrates, Galen, and the rest, for some of them were humble, chaste and modest,
            while others vaunted the virtues of their knowledge."</p>
          <p>Abū al-Faraj b. Hindū in his book "The Key to Medicine" mentioned that he had seen in
            Persia a group who was refuting the medical art. head of this opposing party was an
            enemy of his master Abū al-Khayr b. al-Khammār the philosopher and urged the masses to
            do him harm. Once that leader was suffering from a headache and Abū al-Khayr was
            consulted He said: "He must place under his head the book in which he opposed medicine,
            so that God will cure him." But he would not treat him.</p>

          <p> was a well-known physician from the town of Fasā in Persia, a distinguished medical
            practitioner and researcher. He served the Buwayhid dynasty, in particular King Bahā'
            al-Dawlah b. ʿAdūd al-Dawlah, whom he accompanied on his travels and from whom he won
            great favors. When the Emir of the Emirs Abū Mansūr Buwayhi b. Bāhā' al-Dawlah fell ill
            in Rajab of the year 398/March 1008 while staying with his father in Basrah, Bahā'
            al-Dawlah decided to leave that city and go to Tastur to hunt and make merry. He had
            great pity for this son of his and kept a close watch on him for fear he might get hurt,
            forbidding the soldiers to frequent him. The boy stayed with his father like one
            imprisoned, forbiden to indulge his desires. Now it happened that in Kajab on the eve of
            the day on which his father had intended to go hunting, this boy was afflicted with
            fever which weakened him considerably. The nobleman responsible for him said to Bahā'
            al-Dawlah: "The Emir of the Emirs has fever and it is not advisable to move him. My
            opinion is to leave him hero." —"No, let him be carried at once without any further
            talk.'' — "But if he is excited it will be the end of him, and he will refuse to stay
            behind for a long time." The King would not listen to the nobleman, but asked our
            physician al-Ḥasan al-Fasawī to go to his son and examine him, for he had confidence in
            him. The physician went and examined him, and then came back, saying: "It is right to
            leave him and postpone his departure." He then discreetly pointed out the graveness of
            his son's illness and explained its symptoms, so that the King despaired of his life. He
            then agreed to leave him behind. However, the boy's illness grew worse owing to
            complications, and he died on Sunday the 2nd of Shaʿban 398/ June 1008.</p>

            in the Creation of Man" in his script, which is the essence of beauty and correctness,
            perfection and exactness. This book is his best and most useful, for in it he gathered
            the sayings of Galen and others concerning the functions of the members in the clearest
            and simplest language, with personal additions which prove his outstanding virtue and
            profound knowledge. In the introduction he says: "Only he who compares between our part
            and theirs can appreciate the superiority of our contribution. This comparison must be
            made with prudence and impartiality, for one who does not study a thing carefully is not
            entitled to judge it and one who is not impartial cannot decide what is preferable. The
            one entitled to real criticism is the impartial scholar, who studies carefully and
            thoroughly our contribution and that of the others; he will notice how we have
            corrected, improved and supplemented, simplified and reordered the material in a way
            which is better fitting to the whole discourse and to each part of it; how we have
            dropped what is not related to this branch of the sciences and how much we have added as
            our contribution of detailed and secret <pb n="564" ed="kopf"/> meanings which were
            hidden from them, either for their subtlety or for their loftiness; how we have proved
            subsequent matters by former phenomena (as opposed to what they had done), so that
            everything will be clear with its fundamentals and causes, and will constitute a true
            argument."</p>
          <p>I have heard the illustrious shaykh and leading physician Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd
            al-Raḥīm b. ʿAlī, may God bless him, say: "I cannot find among the early and late
            Christian physicians anyone who is better than Abū Sahl al-Masīḥī in eloquence, good
            expression, and fine meaning." It is said that al-Masīḥī was the teacher of Ibn Sīnā in
            medicine, and that only after that became distinguished and skilled in it, and also in
            the philosophical sciences, to the point where he composed books for al-Masīḥī and
            called them after him.</p>
          <p>ʿUbayd Allāh b. Jibrā'īl said that al-Masīḥī lived in Khurāsān and was favored by its
            sultan. He died when he was forty years of age. One of his sayings is: "Taking a nap
            during the day after eating is better than taking a good medicine." </p>
          <p>His books are the following:</p>

          <head>IBN SĪNĀ (Avicenna)</head>
          <head><persName>Al-Shaykh al-Ra'īs b. Sīnā,</persName></head>
          <p> i.e., Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥusayn b. ʿAbdallāh b. al-Ḥasan b. ʿAlī b. Sīnā. He is so well known
            that there is no need to introduce him, and his merits are so renowned that they need
            not be recorded. He himself related the circumstances of his life in such detail that
            there is no point in anyone else's repeating then; for this reason I shall restrict
            myself to presenting his own story and to reproducing the biography given by his friend
            Abū ʿUbaid al-Jūzjānī. This is the gist of what al-Shaykh al-Ra'īs told about himself,
            as transmitted by Abū ʿUbaid al-Jūzjānī:</p>
          <p>Al-Shaykh al-Ra'īs said: "My father was a native of Balkh, but moved from that city to
            Bukhārā in the days of Nūh b. Mansūr and, during the reign of that prince, was appointed
            governor of the village of Kharmaithan, a government estate in the Bukhārā region and a
            most excellent locality. Near it is another village, Afshana, where my father married my
            mother and settled down. In that village I, and later my brother, was born. Then we
            moved to Bukhārā itself. I became a teacher of the Qur'ān and of literature. At the age
            of ten, I had already mastered the whole of the Qur'ān and an abundance of literature,
            so that I was held in great esteem. My father was one of those who responded to the call
            of the Egyptian propagandists and became a member of the Ismaʿīli sect, where upon he
            heard orations on the soul and intelligence after the fashion they used to discourse
            upon these subjects. The same went for my brother. Quite often they conversed with each
            other, and I listened to, and <pb n="566" ed="kopf"/> understood, what they were saying,
            but my soul could not agree with it. They tried to persuade me, discoursing upon
            philosophy, geometry and Indian calculus [arithmetic]. Then [my father] sent me to a
            vegetable dealer who was well-versed in Indian calculus, in order that I might learn
            from him.</p>
          <p>Later, Abū ʿAbdallāh al-Nātilī, called the philosopher, came to Bukhara, and my father
            lodged him in our house in the hope that he would teach me. Prior to his arrival I had
            applied myself to the study of law, attending the lessons of Ismaʿīl the Ascetic. I was
            a very good debater, since I had become familiar with the customary ways of asking
            questions and raising objections to the answers. Thereafter I began to study
            [Porphyry's] "Isagoge" under the tuition of al-Nātilī, and when, upon my question, he
            told me the definition of a genus, saying it was a category comprising many different
            species. I began to verify this definition in a way he had never heard of. Full of
            admiration, he warned my father not to let me occupy myself with anything but science.
            Whatever problem he set me I solved better than he. I studied the rudiments of logic
            under his tuition, but as to its intricacies, he was not acquainted with them. I then
            started reading books by myself with the help of commentaries, until I achieved complete
            mastery of the art of logic.</p>
          <p>The same procedure was applied to Euclid's Book [of Elements]. I studied the first five
            or six chapters under al-Nātilī and then undertook to solve [the problems of] the
            remaining parts by myself. Next I turned to the Almagest, and when I had finished the
            introductory parts and reached the chapter on geometry, al-Nātilī said to me: "Try to
            study and solve them by yourself and then report to me what you have found so that I may
            tell you what is right and what is wrong." He had not mastered the book and after I had
            worked out the solutions, [it became clear] how many [difficult] passages he had not
            understood until I expounded them to him. <pb n="567" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>Later, al-Nātilī left me and went to Kurkānj, and I applied myself to the study of
            natural history and metaphysics, reading both original texts and commentaries. The gates
            of knowledge opened to me. I then felt an inclination for medicine and set myself to
            perusing books on this subject. Medicine is not one of the difficult sciences; no
            wonder, therefore that I had soon made such progress in it that distinguished physicians
            came to study under me. I also tended the sick and thus gained an indescribable amount
            of practical knowledge of methods of treatment. In addition, I continued studying law
            and participating in discussions on this subject. At that time I was [only] sixteen
            years old.</p>
          <p>Thereafter I devoted a year and a half entirely to study and reading, revising [texts
            on] logic and all the branches of philosophy. During this period I never slept a whole
            night, nor did I use the daytime for anything but study. I kept some blank sheets before
            me, and whenever I came across a difficult problem, I set it down and then considered
            what conclusions might be drawn from it so that, in the end, the solution came to me.
            Whenever I was baffled by a problem and could not determine the answer, I repaired to
            the great mosque and humbly prayed to the Creator until the obscure became clear and the
            difficult easy. In the evening I returned home, placed a lamp in front of me and applied
            myself to reading and writing. When sleep threatened to overpower me or I felt weak, I
            drank a cup of sharāb in order that my strength might be restored and I might be able to
            go on reading. Whenever I actually did doze off, 1 would dream of the very problem which
            had been occupying my mind, so that I solved many questions while asleep. I persevered
            in this way until I had mastered all the sciences and knew as much of them as is within
            the power of man to know. Everything I learnt at that time is as fresh in my memory as
            if I had learnt it now, and I have added nothing.</p>
          <p>So I mastered logic, the natural sciences and mathematics. Then I turned to metaphysics
            and read the "Book of Metaphysics," but I did not <pb n="568" ed="kopf"/> understand it,
            and the purpose of the author remained obscure to me. I reread it forty times, so that I
            came to know it by heart, but I still did not understand it nor the aim it served. I
            despaired of myself and said: This is a book which is impossible to comprehend. One day,
            at the time of the afternoon prayer, I happened to pass through the booksellers'
            [quarter] when I saw in the hand of an auctioneer a volume that he was advertising and
            offering to me. I gruffly declined the offer, convinced that such a purchase would be of
            no advantage. Whereupon he said to me: "Buy it for it is cheap. I am selling it to you
            for three dirhams because its owner is in need of money." So I bought it and behold, it
            was a book by Abū Nasr al-Farabī on the purpose of the "Book of Metaphysics." I went
            home, hastened to read it, and presently understood the "Book of Metaphysics," because I
            remembered its contents. I was delighted and the next day spent a considerable amount in
            alms to the poor as a thanksgiving to God the Exalted.</p>

          <p>At that time, Nūh b. Mansūr was Sultan of Bukhara. He contracted a disease which the
            physicians vainly tried to cure. As my name was well known among the medical men by
            reason of my assiduous studies, they mentioned me to the Sultan and advised him to send
            for me. I came and joined them in attending the Sultan, and as a consequence, I entered
            his service.</p>
          <p>One day, I asked his permission to enter the court library, examine it and read its
            store of medical books. He granted my request, and I entered a building of many rooms,
            each of which were piled high with bookshelves. In one room were books on the Arabic
            language and on poetry, in another [books on] jurisprudence, so on, each room containing
            books on a specific subject. I perused the catalogue of the ancients and picked out
            those books that I needed. I saw books the titles of which many had never heard of and
            which I had never seen before or did see afterward. I read those books, profited by
            their contents and came to know the position occupied by each author in his
            discipline.</p>
          <p>When I was eighteen years of age, I was already familiar with all these sciences. At
            that time my memory was better able to absorb facts, but <pb n="569" ed="kopf"/> my
            knowledge is now more mature. At any rate, it is the same knowledge, for nothing new has
            accrued to me since. </p>
          <p>There lived in my neighborhood a man named Abū'l-Ḥusayn al-ʿArūdī. He asked me to write
            a compendium of science for him, which I did and which I named after him. It deals with
            all the sciences except mathematics. At the time I was twenty-one years old.</p>
          <p>Another of my neighbors was a man named Abū Bakr al-Barqī, who was born in Khwārizm. He
            was a renowned jurist, devoting himself entirely to jurisprudence, Qur'anic exegesis and
            ascetic practices. But he felt an inclination for the sciences and asked me to write
            commentaries on certain books for him. I wrote for him "al-Hāsil wal-Mahsūl," comprising
            nearly twenty volumes, and also — in the field of ethics — a book entitled "Virtue and
            Sin." These two books are to be found only with him for he never lent them to anyone for
            copying.</p>
          <p>Then my father died and life underwent frequent changes. After serving in the
            administration of the Sultan, I was obliged to leave Bukhārā and to proceed to Kurkānj,
            where Abū'l-Ḥusayn al-Sahlī, a lover of the sciences, held the office of vizier. I was
            introduced to the Emir ʿAlī b. Maʿmūn, dressed in the garb of a jurist with the tailasān
            and the taht al-hanak. I was granted a monthly allowance sufficient for the maintenance
            of a person of my standing.</p>
          <p>I was subsequently compelled to leave for Nasā and from there to move to one place
            after another: Bāward, Tūs, Shaqān, Samnīgān, Jājirm on the border of Khurāsān and
            Jurjān. In Jurjān, it had been my intention to visit the Emir Qābus, but it so happened
            that he had in the meantime been arrested and imprisoned in one of the citadels, where
            he died. I then went to Dihistān, where I fell seriously ill, whereupon I returned to
            Jurjān. There I struck up a friendship with Abū ʿUbayd al-Jūzjānī and composed a poem
            about myself, which includes the following line of another poet: <pb n="570" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <quote><p><l>"Since I have become great, there is no place that can contain me; </l><l>
                And since my price is high, no one is able to buy me." </l></p></quote>
          <p>Abū ʿUbayd al-Jūzjānī, the friend of al-Shaykh al-Ra'īd, says: "The forgoing is what
            the Shaykh told me in his own words. From here on [I report what] I have myself
            witnessed of the circumstances of his life:</p>
          <p>There lived in Jurjān a man named Abū Muḥammad al-Shīrazī, who loved the sciences. He
            bought a house in his neighborhood for the Shaykh and lodged him therein. I visited him
            every day to study the Almagest and to write down [texts on] logic from his dictation.
            He dictated to me his treatise on this subject, "al-Mukhtasar al-Aussat." For Abū
            Muḥammad al-Shīrāzī he wrote the "K. al-Mabdā' wal-Maʿād" and the "K.al-Arsād
            al-Kulīya." He wrote many other books in Jurjān, such as the beginning of his Qānūn, and
            abridgment of the Almagest and a great number of treatises. His other books were written
            in Ard al-Jabal.</p>
          <p>Here is a list of his books:</p>

          <p>[From Jurjān] Ibn Sīnā proceeded to al-Rayy, where he entered the service of the
            Sayyida and her son Majd al-Dawlah. They already knew about him from letters of
            recommendation received at the time of his arrival. Majd al-Dawlah was suffering from
            melancholy at that time and Ibn Sīnā was able to cure him.</p>
          <p>In al-Rayy, Ibn Sīnā wrote, the "Book of Resurrection." He stayed in that town until it
            was captured by Shams al-Dawlah after the murder of Hilāl b. Badr b. Hasnawaih and the
            rout of the Baghdādi army. Then certain events compelled him to go to Qazwin and thence
            to Hamadān, where he entered the service of Kadhbānwaih, assuming the management of the
            latter's estate.</p>
          <p>Subsequently Shams al-Dawlah heard about him and had him come to his court because of a
            colic that had struck him. Ibn Sīnā treated him until God restored him to health; for
            this performance he was rewarded with numerous robes of honor. He returned home after
            spending forty days and nights at Shams al-Dawlah's court.</p>
          <p>He became one of the companions of the Emir. When the latter set out for Quarmisin to
            wage war on ʿAnaz, the Shaykh accompanied him. After the Emir had been defeated and came
            back to Hamadān, Ibn Sīnā was asked to take up the office of vizier, and he did so. But
            the army became dissatisfied with him, fearing that he would act aginst their welfare.
            So they attacked his house, took him prisoner, seized all his property and bade the Emir
            kill him. Though <pb n="572" ed="kopf"/> declining their request, the Emir nevertheless
            banished him from the country in order to preserve their goodwill. For forty days Ibn
            Sīnā hid in the house of the Shaykh Abū Sa'd b. Dukhdūk. Thereafter the Emir Shams
            al-Dawlah had another attack of colic. He sent for Ibn Sīnā, who presented himself at
            court, and apologized to him profusely. Ibn Sīnā cured him and stayed on, esteemed and
            revered.</p>
          <p>[Abū ʿUbayd al-Jūzjānī said:] When I asked him to write a commentary on the books of
            Aristotle, he replied that he had no leisure to do so just then, adding, however: "If
            you will be satisfied with a book mentioning what seems to be true of those teachings,
            without entering into a discussion of its opponents and without refuting their
            arguments, I shall do it." I agreed, and he set about writing the chapter on natural
            history, being part of a book which he entitled "al-Shifa'."At that time he had already
            written the first book of the "Qānūn."</p>
          <p>Every night, students would assemble at his home. I and another would read,
            alternately, portions of the "Shifa'" and the "Qānūn," and when we had finished, singers
            of various description appeared and a regular carousal took place. The lectures had to
            be given at night since in the daytime Ibn Sīnā was wholly taken up with the service of
            the Emir. In this way we continued for some time.</p>
          <p>Then Shams al-Dawlah set out on his campaign against the Emir of Tārim. Near the latter
            place, he again had an attack of colic which caused him great suffering. In addition, he
            was afflicted with diseases resulting from his bad habits and from his refusal to heed
            the advice of the Shaykh. The soldiers, fearing he might die, turned back and made their
            way toward Hamadān, carrying him on a stretcher [?]. He died thus en route.</p>
          <p>Therefore, Shams al-Dawlah' s son was recognized as ruler. He was requested to appoint
            the Shaykh his vizier, but refused. Ibn Sīnā therefore secretly wrote to ʿAlā'
            al-Dawlah, asking for  <pb n="573" ed="kopf"/> employment and suggesting that he might
            go over to him. He hid in the house of Abū Ghalib al-ʿAttar. I asked him to complete the
            "K. al-Shifa'," and he called Abū Ghalib, requested paper and an inkstand, which were
            duly supplied, and then with his own hand, wrote the chapter headings on about twenty
            sheets (folded into] octavo size. He spent two days writing all the chapter headings
            from memory without recourse to a single book. He then put the sheets in front of him,
            took some paper, pondered each problem and wrote down its solution. Every day he filled
            fifty sheets, until he had completed the portions dealing with the natural sciences and
            metaphysics, except for the two chapters on zoology and botany. Then he started on the
            portion related to logic, but when he had written one sheet, Tāj al-Mulk denounced him
            for his correspondence with ʿAlā' al-Dawlah, of which he strongly disapproved, and
            insisted on his being arrested. One of his foes betrayed him; he was seized and confined
            in the citadel called Fardajan. There he composed a poem containing the following
            lines:</p>
          <quote><p><l>"That I have entered here is certain, as you see. </l><l> But there is every
                doubt as to my getting out again."</l></p></quote>
          <p>He had been in the citadel for four months when ʿAlā' al-Dawlah marched on Hamadān and
            captured it. Tāj al-Mulk was defeated and retreated to the very same citadel [in which
            Ibn Sīnā was imprisoned]. Later, ʿAla' al-Dawlah withdrew from Hamadān, and Tāj al-Mulk
            and Shams al-Dawlah's son returned to the city, taking the Shaykh with them. He took up
            quarters at al-ʿAlawi's house, where he applied himself to writing the chapter on logic
            of the "K. al-Shifa." During his stay at the citadel he had written the "K. al-Hidāyāt,"
            the "Risāla Hayy b. Yaqzān" and the "Book of Colic." The "Adwiya Qalbiyya," was written
            shortly after his arrival at Hamadān. Since then, quite a long time had elapsed, during
            which Tāj al-Mulk had made him fine promises. <pb n="574" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>Then the Shaykh conceived the idea of going to Isfahan. He departed, disguised as a
            sufi, accompanied by me, his brother and two servants. After many hardships, we reached
            Tabarān on the outskirts of Isfahan, where we were met by friends of the Shaykh and
            companions and courtiers of the Emir ʿAlā' al-Dawlah. The Shaykh was given special
            raiment and carriages and was lodged in the Kūnkanabd Quarter at ʿAbdallah b. Bābī's
            house, which contained all the necessary utensils and furniture. He appeared at ʿAlā'
            al-Dawlah's court, and was received with the honor and esteem due to a person of his
            standing. The Emir ordered study sessions to be held in his presence every Friday eve,
            attended by a variety of scholars, including the Shaykh; it was found that no one
            matched the Shaykh in his knowledge of any of the sciences.</p>
          <p>In Isfahan, he applied himself to completing the "K. al-Shifa'," finishing the chapters
            on logic and the Almagest. Previously he had epitomized Euclid's "Elements,"
            "Arithmetic" and "Music." To each of the chapters dealing with mathematics he made
            additions as far as he thought necessary. To the Almagest he added ten paragraphs on the
            "changes of the aspect," and at the end of the book he inserted some remarks on
            astronomy which no one had made before. To the "Elements," he added similar figures, to
            the "Arithmetic" explanatory notes and to the "Music" certain matters which his
            predecessors had ignored. So the book known as "al-Shifa'" was completed, except for the
            two chapters on animals and plants; these two he wrote while en route to Sābur Khwāst
            with ʿAla' al-Dawlah. The "K. al-Najāh" was likewise written while he was traveling. He
            was a devoted servant of ʿAlā' al-Dawlah and one of his companions. When ʿAlā' al-Dawlah
            marched on Hamadān, he traveled in his retinue.</p>
          <p>One evening, it was mentioned in the presence of ʿAlā' al-Dawlah that the calendars
            drawn up on the basis of early observations, were faulty; whereupon the Emir ordered the
            Shaykh to undertake the <pb n="575" ed="kopf"/> observation of the stars concerned, for
            which purpose he granted him as much money as was needed. The Shaykh set to work,
            instructing me to provide the necessary instruments and to engage technicians, until
            many of the problems had been solved. The defect in the earlier observations had been
            due to their being carried out in widely different places.</p>
          <p>In Isfahan the Shaykh wrote the "Kitāb al-ʿAlā'ī." It is interesting to note that,
            during the twenty-five years I was his associate and servant, I never saw him read a
            newly acquired book right through; rather he picked out the difficulties raised in it
            and read what the author had to say about them, so as to arrive at a correct
            appreciation of his knowledge and understanding.</p>
          <p>One day, the Shaykh was sitting before the Emir in the presence of Abū Mansūr
            al-Jiba'ī, when a lexicographical question came up for discussion. While the Shaykh was
            discoursing upon it to the best of his ability, Abū Mansūr turned to him saying: "You
            are a philosopher and a physician, but you have not studied lexicography to such an
            extent that your observations are acceptable." The Shaykh, peeved at this remark,
            devoted the next three years to a study of lexicographical works. [Among other things]
            he had Abū Mansūr al-Azharī's dictionary, "Tahdhīb al-Lughgha," sent to him from
            Khurasan. Eventually he attained such perfect knowledge of lexicography as is but rarely
            met with. He composed three poems in which he inserted a number of abstruse words, and
            wrote three epistles, one in the style of Ibn al-ʿAmīd, another in the style of al-Sabī,
            and the third in the style of al-Sāhib [i.e., Ibn ʿAbbād]. He had them bound in a worn
            cover and then asked the Emir to show the volume to Abū Mansūr al-Jiba'ī. While so
            doing, the Emir said: "I found this volume while hunting in the desert. It is now for
            you to examine it and tell me what it contains." Abū Mansūr inspected the volume, but
            much of its content was obscure to him. Then the <pb n="576" ed="kopf"/> Shaykh said:
            "What you do not understand of this book is to be found in such and such a place in the
            dictionaries." And he mentioned to him a great number of dictionaries in which he had
            looked up those words. Abū Mansūr was no authority on lexicography, but he realized,
            that the epistles had been written by the Shaykh himself and that he had been induced to
            write them by the insult which had stung him that day; he now apologized to him.
            Thereafter, the Shaykh compiled a dictionary entitled "Lisān al-ʿArab" (The Language of
            the Arabs), the like of which had never been written before. Yet he did not live to
            prepare the final version; indeed, he did not get beyond the first draft, and there was
            no one to do the editing.</p>
          <p>In his medical practice, the Shaykh gained a great deal of experience which he intended
            to embody in the Qānūn. He put down the case-histories on loose sheets, which however,
            were lost, before the Qanūn was completed. One case was as follows. One day he had a
            headache, and he perceived that some substance was about to descend to his forehead,
            where it would doubtless have caused a swelling. He gave orders to fetch a large
            quantity of ice, pound it, wrap it in a cloth and cover his head with it. As a result,
            the place in question was strengthened, so that it was able to resist that substance,
            and the Shaykh was cured. Another case was this: A woman of Khwārizm, afflicted with
            tuberculosis, was ordered by him to take no medicine but sugared "jalanjabīn"
            [Maimonides 85: miel rosat]. When in the course of time, she had taken the quantity of
            one hundred mann, her health was restored.</p>
          <p>In Jurjān the Shaykh wrote the "Smaller Compendium on Logic," which he later placed at
            the beginning of the "K. al-Najāh." A copy of it reached Shīrāz, and when a group of
            local scholars studied it, they were baffled by certain problems, which they wrote down
            on a sheet of paper. The Qādi of Shirāz was one of that group. He forwarded the sheet,
            by a mounted messenger leaving [for Jurjān], <pb n="577" ed="kopf"/> to Abū 'l-Qāsim
            al-Kirmānī, a friend of Ibrāhīm b. Bābā al-Dailāmī, who was preoccupied with the science
            of "al-tanāzur" [Ibn al-Qiftī: "al-bātin"]. He added a letter for the Shaykh [Ibn Sīnā]
            begging Abū 'l-Qāsim to submit the sheet to the latter and ask him to answer the
            questions inscribed on it. Abū 'l-Qāsim went to Ibn Sīnā's residence at dusk on a
            summer's day to deliver the letter and the sheet. Ibn Sīnā read the letter, returned it
            to Abū 'l-Qāsim but retained the sheet, which he began to study while the people [in the
            house] were talking. When Abū'l-Qāsim had left, the Shaykh ordered me to fetch some
            blank paper and cut it into sheets. I prepared five, each containing 10 quarto leaves of
            fir ʿaunī size. We then recited the evening prayer, candles were brought and the Shaykh
            ordered sherbet [?] to be served. Hie invited me and his brother to sit down and drink
            sherbet with him, and he began to prepare the answers to those questions. He wrote and
            drank until midnight, by which time sleep overtook me and his brother, and he asked us
            to leave. The following morning there came a knock at the door; it was the messenger of
            the Shaykh asking me to come to him. When I presented myself, he was on the prayer rug,
            with the five sheets lying before him. He said to me: "Take these and deliver them to
            the Shaykh Abū 'l-Qāsim al-Kirmānī. Tell him that I have hastened to prepare the answers
            in order that the messenger might not be delayed." When I brought them to Abū 'l-Qāsim,
            he was greatly astonished and despatched the messenger immediately. He published this
            episode, and it made a tremendous impression on the people.</p>
          <p>For observation of the stars, Ibn Sīnā invented new instruments and wrote a treatise on
            them. I myself engaged in astronomical observation for eight years with the object of
            elucidating what Ptolemy had reported of his own observations, some of which I was able
            to verity.</p>
          <p>After the Shaykh had written the "K. al-Insāf," his baggage was plundered by the
            soldiery the day Sultan Masʿud entered Isfahan. <pb n="578" ed="kopf"/> Among the things
            taken was the said book, which subsequently was not discovered.</p>
          <p>The Shaykh was vigorous in every respect. Of his physical powers, sexual potency was
            the strongest and the best developed. He exercised it most freely, and not without
            effect upon his state of health. He so much relied on his robust constitution that he
            sometimes went too far. In the year in which ʿAlā' al-Dawlah fought Tāsh Farāsh at the
            gates of al-Karkh, he was afflicted with a colic, and being anxious to recover, since in
            the event of a defeat he might be unable to travel with his illness, he took eight
            clysters in one day; the result was ulceration and excoriation of a part of his
            intestine. He was forced to flee with ʿAlā' al-Dawlah, who hastened toward Idhaj. There
            he experienced the prostration which sometimes attends colic. He nevertheless continued
            taking clysters for the excoriation and the lingerings of the colic. One day, he ordered
            two dānaqs of parsley seed to be put in the mixture used for the clysters, intending
            thereby to stop the emission of wind from the anus, but the physician he had entrusted
            with the treatment put in five drachms of parsley seed (I do not know whether on purpose
            or by mistake, since I was not present); the result was that the excoriation increased
            owing to the pungency of those seeds. In Tūs he took mathrud to combat his prostration,
            but one of his servants put a large quantity of opium into it, served it up to him, and
            he ate it. The reason for this action was that the servants had embezzled a large sum of
            money from his treasury and wished him dead in order to escape punishment.</p>
          <p>In his sick condition the Shaykh was transferred to Isfahan, where he resumed treating
            himself. He was so weak as to be unable to stand. Through further treatment he managed
            to walk and to appear at the court of ʿAlā' al-Dīn. But he did not take care of himself,
            being over-indulgent with regard to sexual intercourse. He never fully recovered and was
            subject to frequent relapses. <pb n="579" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>When ʿAlā' al-Dawlah left for Hamadān, the Shaykh accompanied him. On the way, the
            illness recurred and lasted until he reached Hamadān. He knew that his strength was
            sapped and that it would not be sufficient to overcome the malady. He therefore
            refrained from treating himself, saying: "The manager who has been operating my body is
            no longer able to control it, and no treatment will avail now." He remained in this
            state for a while and was then transferred to the custody of God. He was 53 years old
            when he died in 428/1037. The year of his birth was 375/984. Here ends Abū ʿUbayd's
            account of the life of al-Shaykh al-Ra'īs.</p>
          <p>His tomb lies under the walls on the southern side of Hamadān. According to one report,
            his body was transferred to Isfahān and buried near the Kaunkanbad Gate.</p>
          <p>When Ibn Sīnā died of the colic that afflicted him, one of his contemporaries wrote in
            a poem:</p>
          <quote><p><l>I saw Ibn Sīnā with men of distinction,</l><l> But in prison he met a most
                wretched death.</l><l> He could not with the "Shifā'" overcome the calamity
                befalling him </l><l> Nor was he rescued from death by the "Najāh." </l></p></quote>
          <p>[There follow a few brief remarks on the above lines. ]</p>
          <p>Specimen of the Poetry of al-Shaykh al-Ra'īs</p>
          <p>The following poem on the soul is one of the noblest and most sublime examples of his
            poetry:</p>
          <quote><p><l>It descended upon thee from the lofty station </l><l> — a dove, proud and
                inaccessible, <pb n="580" ed="kopf"/>
              </l><l> Curtained from the eye of every knowing [creature]. </l><l> Yet it itself is
                uncovered and never wore a veil. </l><l> It came to thee unwillingly, and it may
                perhaps </l><l> Be unwilling to abandon thee, although it complains of its
                sufferings.</l><l> It first resisted and would not become familiar, but when
                agreeing to the union </l><l> It grew accustomed to the wrecked ruin [the body].
                </l><l> Methinks that it forgot the memories of meetings in the protected ground
                </l><l> And those abodes which it left with regret.</l></p></quote>

          <p> Abū 'l-Qāsim ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. ʿAlī b. Aḥmad b. Abī Sādiq al Naisābūrī was a
            distinguished physician, well versed in philosophy and an experienced medical
            practitioner. He devoured the books of Galen, especially the portions dealing with the
            mysteries of the medical art, and strenuously explored the theoretical foundations and
            practical application of medicine. He used elegant language and was an impressive
            speaker. His commentaries on the books of Galen are excellent and thoroughly done, an
            example being his commentary on Galen's "The Usefulness of the Limbs," which he took
            great pains in writing and excellently developed the themes of the original. At the
            beginning, he says: "I re-edited the book, explaining obscure passages, deleting
            superfluous matter, assembling dispersed items and adding material that I gleaned from
            Galen's [other] writings and <pb n="585" ed="kopf"/> the works of other authorities in
            this field. I systematically arranged the subject matter of each chapter and appended to
            the end of it explanations of the anatomy of the organ whose medicinal applications are
            discussed. In this way, the gathering of information on the anatomy of any organ or on
            the [medicinal] use of any of its parts has been facilitated." He finished this book in
            the year 459/1068.</p>
          <p>I have been told by a certain physician that Ibn Abī Sādiq was in touch with al-Shaykh
            al-Ra'īs b. Sīnā and studied under him. I do not consider this report implausible. On
            the contrary, it may well be correct, for Ibn Abī Sadiq was Ibn Sīnā's contemporary and
            lived in Persia; moreover Ibn Sīnā's prestige was enormous, as was his knowledge and the
            number of his disciples. Also, he was older and higher placed than Ibn Abī Sādiq.</p>
          <p>Ibn Abī Sādiq was the author of the following works: 1) A commentary on the "Book of
            Problems," a medical treatise by Hunayn b. Isḥāq. 2) An abridgment of his lengthy
            commentary on Hunayn's "Book of Problems." 3) A commentary on Hippocrates' "Aphorisms";
            on [a manuscript of] this commentary, a note was found in his own handwriting, dated A.
            H. 460/1069, to the effect that so-and-so had studied it under his guidance. 4) A
            commentary on Hippocrates' "introduction to Knowledge. " 5) A commentary on Galen's
            "Uses of the Parts of Animals"; I have seen the original copy of this book in which the
            year of its completion was given as 459/1068; it bore a postscript in his own hand which
            read as follows: "Checked and found to be correct if God the Exalted, in Whom we trust,
            so wills." 6) Abū 'l-Asim wrote, with his own hand, treatise dispelling the doubts
            raised by al-Rāzi with regard to Galen's writings. 7) "K. al-Taʿrīkh" [Book of History;
            possibly a history of physicians]. <pb n="586" ed="kopf"/>

            Muḥammad b. ʿUmar b. al-Ḥusayn al-Rāzī was foremost among the later generations and
            chief among the more recent savants. His virtuosity has become widely known, and his
            writings and disciples have spread all over the world. When he was riding out, 300
            disciples, jurists and others walked in his retinue. Khwārizmshāh came to visit him.</p>
          <p>He showed an extremely strong propensity for all the religious and philosophical
            sciences, and possessed fine natural talents, a keen intellect and beautiful diction [in
            short], he was a man of great merit. He gave much thought to medicine and its problems
            and was also a man of letters, composing poems in Persian as well as in Arabic. His body
            was plump and squat, and he wore a huge beard. His voice was sonorous. He delivered
            sermons in his native town of al-Rayy and in other cities, discoursing from the pulpit
            upon various philosophical subject. People of different scientific interests and
            occupations came to him from all lands and all directions, and each of them found full
            satisfaction of his desires. <pb n="587" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>The Imam Fakhr al-Dīn studied philosophy in Marāgha under Majd al-Dīn al-Jīlī, one of
            the greatest personalities of his time. He wrote excellent books. Qādī Shams al-Dīn
            al-Khuyī related to me the following saying of Shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn: "By God, I very much
            regret that I have to give up study during meals, for time is precious." Muhyi al-Dīn,
            the Qādī of Marnad [?] told me as follows: "In Marnad, Shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn attended the
            college where my father was a teacher. He studied law under him and afterwards took up
            philosophy by himself. He so distinguished himself that he outshone everyone. I met him
            at Hamadān and Harāt and studied under him. The atmosphere at his study circle was
            awe-inspiring; he behaved haughtily even in the presence of kings. During sessions, some
            of his older disciples, such as Zain al-Dīn al-Kashshī, al-Qutb al-Misrī and Shihāb
            al-Dīn al-Naisābūrī, sat next to him, followed by the remainder of his pupils and the
            other people in the order of their rank. When someone had spoken about a certain topic,
            he was interrogated by those veteran disciples, and if a difficult problem or abstruse
            theme were on the agenda, the Shaykh himself took part in the discussion and discoursed
            upon that item in a means so superb as to defy description.</p>
          <p>Shams al-Dīn Muḥammad Al-Waththār al-Mauilī told me: "I was in Harāt in the year six
            hundred .... [blank in original], when Shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn, coming from Bāmyān, entered
            the city with great pomp and a large suite. On his arrival, he was received with great
            honor by the Sultan of Harāt, Ḥusayn Kharmain, who later erected for him a pulpit with a
            prayer rug in the front part of the dais [iwan] at the local great mosque. He was to sit
            in this place on a memorable day, so that the masses could see him and listen to his
            words. On that day I was present with the others, standing by the side of Sharaf al-Dīn
            b. ʿUnain, the poet, may God have mercy upon him. The place was filled with a large
            crowd. Shaykh Fakhr-al-Dīn was in <pb n="588" ed="kopf"/> the front part of the dais,
            flanked on each side by some of his Turkish mamelukes leaning on their swords. Sultan
            Ḥusayn Kharmain, the ruler of Harāt, approached and saluted him, and the Shaykh invited
            him to sit at his side. Sultan Mahmud, the son of Shihāb Dīn al-Ghaurī's sister and
            ruler of Fairuzkuh, also approached and saluted, and the Shaykh asked him to sit next to
            him on the other side. In a spirited discourse the Shaykh was eloquently holding forth
            on the soul when suddenly a dove appeared in the precincts of the mosque, pursued by a
            hawk that was on the point of capturing it. The dove circled round the mosque until
            exhausted, and then repaired to the dais where the Shaykh was, flew in between the two
            rows of soldiers and eventually alighted in front of the Shaykh, and so was rescued.</p>
          <p>Sharaf al-Dīn b. ʿUnain told me that inspired by this incident, he improvised a poem
            and immediately asked the Shaykh's permission to recite it. The Shaykh agreed, and the
            poet recited:</p>
          <quote><p><l>She [the dove] repaired to the Solomon of this age in her distress,</l><l>
                While death was looming from the wings of a ravisher. </l><l> Who told the dove that
                your place was an inviolable sanctuary, </l><l> And that you were a refuge for the
                panic-stricken."</l></p></quote>
          <p>Shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn greatly enjoyed the poem. He called the poet over to him and asked
            him to sit by his side. After the meeting, he sent him a complete robe of honor and a
            large sum of money. He remained his benefactor forever.</p>
          <p>Shams al-Dīn al-Waththār said: "Qudāmā recited only those two verses before Ibn Khatīb,
            but later added further lines to the poem." I have found the additional verses in his
            Divan. They read as follows: <pb n="589" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <quote><p><l>O son of the nobles who are well fed, </l><l> Who are secure while souls fly
                about </l><l> Among sharp swords and bleeding spears, </l><l> Who told the dove that
                your place was an inviolable sanctuary?</l><l> She came to you when death was close

          <p>Say I: Sharaf al-Dīn b. ʿUnain reports that he obtained about 30,000 dinars from Fakhr

          <p>[Here follows another of his poems on Fakhr al-Dīn, sent to him from Naisābūr to
            Harāt:]</p>
          <p>Najm al-Dīn b. Sharaf al-Dīn ʿAlī b. Muḥammad al-Asafzārī told me as follows: "Fakhr
            al-Dīn's father, the Shaykh and Imam Diyā' al-Dīn ʿUmar, was a native of al-Rayy. He
            studied jurisprudence, specializing in the controversies of the different schools of
            Muslim law and in its theoretical foundations, until he became a great authority and was
            almost without rival. He taught at al-Rayy; there at fixed times he also delivered
            sermons which, because of their interesting content and his great eloquence, were
            attended by a large number of people. He thus became famous both among the educated <pb
              n="590" ed="kopf"/> and the common people of the region. He wrote a number of works —
            still extant — on the theoretical foundations of Muslim law and on exhortations. He left
            two sons; one the Imām Fakhr al-Dīn and the other, the elder, Rukn [al-Dīn]. The latter
            possessed certain knowledge of the controversies between the different schools of Muslim
            law, of [practical] jurisprudence and of the theory of Muslim law, but was thoughtless
            and unmethodical. He followed his brother everywhere and defamed both him and those who
            took heed of his writings and words. He would say: "Am I not older and more learned than
            he and better acquainted with the polemics of the schools and the theory of
            jurisprudence? Why, then, do the people shout 'Fakhr al-Dīn, Fakhr al-Dīn,' while I
            never hear them clamoring 'Rukn al-Dīn ?'" He may have written some books, as he claimed
            he did, presenting them with words: "This is better than anything by Fakhr al-Dīn." He
            slandered his brother, so that the people were astonished at him, and many called him
            names [?] and marked him. Whenever something of this nature came to the knowledge of the
            Imām Fakhr al-Dīn, it distressed him greatly. He did not like his brother being in such
            a situation, with no one listening to him. He always treated him kindly and repeatedly
            suggested that he take up residence at al-Rayy or elsewhere, where he would take care of
            him to the best of his ability. Yet whenever he made such a suggestion, his his brother
            became more intractable. This went on until Fakhr al-Dīn saw the Sultan Khwārizmshāh,
            told him about his brother and what he had to suffer through him, and asked that he be
            placed in a certain locality, which he would be forbidden to leave, and provided him
            with everything necessary for his upkeep. The Sultan thereupon placed Rukn al-Dīn in one
            of his castles and assigned to him a fief yielding a thousand dinars a year. He stayed
            there until his death.</p>
          <p>The Imām Fakhr al-Dīn was the foremost scholar of his time in all the sciences. People
            came from everywhere to visit him. He also preached sermons at al-Rayy and maintained a
            large college. <pb n="591" ed="kopf"/> No one was a better orator. He was not
            excessively fat. He had a broad chest, a massive head and a thick beard (although when
            he died in the prime of his life, this had already turned gray). He often spoke about
            death and even wished for it, begging God to have mercy upon him. He would say: "I have
            achieved all that is humanly possible in the sciences, but I have always wanted only one
            thing — to meet God and see His majestic countenance."</p>
          <p>Fakhr al-Dīn left two sons. The elder, Diyā al-Dīn, acquired a certain knowledge of the
            sciences, while the younger, Shams al-Dīn, possessed extraordinary natural talents and
            an unusually bright intellect. The Imām Fakhr al-Dīn frequently alluded to his
            intelligence, saying: "If this son of mine survives, he will become more learned than
            I." His outstanding gifts revealed themselves already in his youth. When the Imām Fakhr
            al-Dīn died, his children remained in Harāt. The younger subsequently adopted the name
            of the father, Fakhr al-Dīn.</p>
          <p>ʿAlā' al-Mulk al-ʿAlawī was appointed vizier by Sultan Khwārizmshāh. He was a
            distinguished personality, who possessed literary skill and composed poems in Arabic and
            Persian. He married the daughter of Shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn. When Genghiz Khān, the king of
            the Tatars, had vanquished Khwārizmshāh and killed most of his soldiers, and
            Khwārizmshāh himself was missing, ʿAlā' al-Mulk went to Genghiz Khān and sought asylum
            with him. Genghiz Khān received him with honors and made him one of his courtiers. When
            the Tatars occupied Persia, destroyed its castles and cities and slaughtered all the
            citizens, sparing no one, ʿAlā' al-Mulk, perceiving that a part of the Tatar army was
            marching on Harāt to destroy the city and kill its inhabitants, asked Genghiz Khān to
            assure the protection of Shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn b. Khatīb al-Rayyī's children and to allow
            him to bring them honorably into his presence. Genghiz Khān granted his request and
            promised safe conduct for them. <pb n="592" ed="kopf"/> When the soldiers were about to
            occupy Harāt, they announced that the children of Fakhr al-Dīn b. al-Khatīb, having been
            granted protection, were to keep by themselves in one place, whereupon they would be
            spared. The house of Shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn, which had been presented to him by its former
            owner, Sultan Khwārizmshān, was one of the largest, most beautiful and most richly
            decorated in Harāt. When Fakhr al-Dīn's children heard of the soldiers' announcement,
            they confidently remained in that house, but they were joined there by a multitude of
            relatives, dignitaries, local notables, lawyers and others, who thought they wouid be
            safe both because of their relationship or association with Fakhr al-Dīn's children and
            merely by their being in their house. The Tatars, after entering the town, struck down
            everyone in their path and when they reached the house of Fakhr al-Dīn, called upon his
            children to make themselves known. When they — i.e., Diyā al-Dīn, Shams al-Dīn and their
            sister — came forward, they led them aside, and then put to the sword all the other
            people in the house. They took the children of Shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn from Harāt to
            Samarkand because the king of the Tatars, Genghiz Khan, was there at the time, and so
            was ʿAlā' al-Mulk. The chronicler ends saying: "And I do not know what became of them
            thereafter."</p>
          <p>I say: Shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn spent most of his life in al-Rayy, but he also visited
            Khwārizm, where he was taken ill, and subsequently died in Harāt. When his illness was
            at its climax, he had his disciple, Ibrāhīm b. Abī Bakr b. ʿAlī al-Isfahānī, take down
            his last message; this was on Sunday, the 21st day of Muharram, 606/1209. He died at the
            Feast of Bairam (ʿId al-Fitr), or the 1st day of Shawwāl of the year mentioned, and was
            transferred to the presence of his Lord. May Allāh, the Exalted, have mercy upon
            him.</p>
          <p>Here is the text of his last words: "In the name of Allāh, the All-merciful! Thus says
            the servant who, hoping for the mercy of his Lord and trusting in the kindness of his
            Master, Muḥammad b. ʿUmar b. al-Ḥusayn al-Razī, is spending his last days in this world
            and is standing on the threshold of the hereafter, this being the time at which every
            cruel person becomes gentle, and every fugitive slave returns to his master: I laud God,
            the Exalted, with the praises uttered by his most sublime angels on the highest rung of
            their ladder and spoken by his greatest prophets in the most lucid moments of <pb
              n="593" ed="kopf"/> their visions, nay I praise Him — for what has happened [?] and
            what may yet take place — with all the praise that His divinity and perfect gifts merit,
            whether I am conscious of them or not, for there is no affinity between dust and the
            majesty of the Lord of Lords. And I bless the angels close to Him, the prophets sent by
            Him and all the righteous servants of God. And I say: Be it known to you, my brethren in
            faith and companions in the quest for truth, that people say: When a man dies, his bond
            with mankind is severed."</p>

          <p> The Imam Qutb al-Dīn Ibrāhīm b. 'Alī b. Muḥammad al-Sulamī originated from the
            Maghrib, but moved to Egypt, where he stayed for a while. Later he traveled to Persia
            and gained fame there. He studied under Fakhr al-Dīn b. Khatib al-Rayyī and became one
            of his most distinguished disciples. His numerous books on medicine and philosophy
            include a commentary on the whole of the general part [Kulliyyāt] of Ibn Sīnā's Qānūn.
            In this work I have found that he gave preference to al-Masīhi and Ibn al-Khatīb over
            the Shaykh Abū ʿAlī b. Sīnā. These are his words: "al-Masīḥī is more adept in the
            medical art than Shaykh Abū ʿAlī, for my teachers preferred him to many who surpassed
            Abū ʿAlī in this field. Al-Masīḥī's diction is more lucid and intelligible than that of
            the Shaykh, who affected an extremely concise style, to no purpose. On the superiority
            he accorded to Ibn al-Khatīb over al-Shaykh al-Ra'īs, he said: "This is apparent from
            the utterances of these two great authorities, the latter of whom surpassed the former
            with regard to knowledge, practice, assurance and method."</p>
          <p>Al-Qutb al-Misrī was killed in the city of Naisābūr when the Tatars occupied the
            Persian domains, killing their inhabitants.</p>

          <p>Al-Qutb al-Misrī wrote a commentary on the general part of al-Shaykh al-Ra'īs b. Sīnā's

            <ref target="#FN8" type="noteAnchor">8</ref> Al-Samau'al b. Yaḥyā b. ʿAbbās al-Maghribī
            distinguished himself in the mathematical sciences and was adept in the art of medicine.
            Originating from the Maghrib, he settled in Baghdād for a time and then moved to Persia,
            where he stayed for the rest of his life. His father, too, possessed some knowledge of
            philosophy.</p>
          <p>I have copied the following from [a manuscript in] the handwriting of Shaykh Muwaffaq
            al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Latīf b. Yūsuf al-Baghdādī: "This youth of Baghdād, al-Samau'al, was a
            Jew who embraced Islam. He died, while still young, in Marāgha. He surpassed all his
            contemporaries in arithmetic and reached a peak of proficiency in algebra. He lived in
            Diyār Bakr and Āzarbaijān.</p>
          <p>In his algebraic treatises he opposed Ibn al-Khashshāb, the grammarian, who was his
            contemporary and had some knowledge of arithmetic and a certain degree of practice in
            algebra. My colleague, Jamāl al-Dīn b. al-Qiftī said: This Samau'al, on arriving in the
            East, traveled to Azārbaijān, where he entered the service of the al-Bahlawān dynasty
            and their emirs. He lived in the city of al-Marāgha and there begot children, who like
            him applied themselves to medicine. He then moved to al-Mausil and Diyār Bakr, embraced
            Islam and became a true believer. He wrote a book in which he demonstrated the errors of
            the Jews, the untruth of their claims with regard to the Pentateuch and the fact of the
            latter's abrogation. The proofs he assembled are judiciously chosen.</p>
          <p>He died in al-Mag'agha around the year 570/1174.</p>

          <p>A brilliant savant, one of the leading Indian philosophers, he had great medical
            insight and understood the effect of drugs, the qualities of natural phenomena and the
            properties of man-made things. He was also knowledgeable concerning the shape of the
            universe, the constellations and the movements of the planets. Abū Muashar b. ʿUmar
            al-Balkhi, in his "Book of the Thousands," said: "Kanka is considered by Indian scholars
            of all ages the leading authority on the science of the stars." Some of Kanka's books
            are:</p>

          <p> was among the finest indian medical experts and astrologers. One of his works is "The
            Great Book of Living Beings." After Sanjahal there arose in India a group of
            philosophers which held well-known theories in medicine and other disciplines: this
            group included Bakhar, Raha, Sakka, Dahar, Ankrazankel, Jabhar, Andi, and Jahri. Rules
            concerning astrology were also set down by these scholars. India has followed the
            precepts set <pb n="601" ed="kopf"/> forth in their works and has propagated their
            teachings. A large number of their books have been translated into Arabic.</p>
          <p>I have found that al-Razi borrowed from Indian sources in his "al-Hawi" [Continens] and
            other books. The works from which he drew include: "Charaka-samhita," a book translated
            from Persian into Arabic by ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿAlī, it having first been translated from
            Indian into Persian; the book "Susruta-samhita," which contains descriptions of diseases
            and their treatment and appropriate drugs. It has ten chapters which Yaḥyā b. Khalfd
            ordered to be translated; the book "Badran," on the diagnostics of 404" diseases, but
            with no discussion of treatment; the book "Sandarshan" and its translation; the book
            "Surat al-Najah"; a book on topics on which India and Rome have differed concerning the
            "hot" and the "cold," the power of drugs, and the division [?] of the year; a book
            dividing possessions into ten types [?]; a book on "Asankar the Universal''; a book on
            the treatment of pregnant women in India; a short work on Indian drugs; a book "Nofshel,
            which deals with one hundred diseases and one hundred drugs; a book by Roussi the
            Indian, on the treatment of women: a book on sugar in India; a book by Rai the Indian on
            snakes and their poisons; a book of conjecture relative to diseases and maladies, by Abū
            Qubail the Indian.</p>

          <p> Another famous Indian physician, known for his therapeutics and experiments. Excelling
            in wisdom and knowledge, he was also a brilliant astrologer and an eloquent speaker,
            favored by kings. From among his sayings I quote one from his book "Muntahal al-Jawhar":
            "King, beware of the vicissitudes of time. Fear the hand of the ruler and the sufferings
            inflicted by fate. Know that a man always receives his deserts; therefore be on your
            guard against the hurdles of destiny and against what the days may bring, for they may
            thwart your plans. The fates have their hidden designs, so be prepared. Fortune is
            shifting, therefore beware of her sovereignty. She can play you false, so should you
            tremble before her. <pb n="602" ed="kopf"/> Know that a man who does not treat his
            disease during his lifetime cannot hope for a remedy in a world where medicines do not
            exist. He who controls his senses shows his virtue and noble soul. He who cannot control
            himself, who is one, would not be able to control his senses, which are five; and if he
            cannot control his senses, which are few and humble, it would be hard for him to control
            his subjects, who are many and arrogant. Thus, the masses would run riot in the remote
            corners of his kingdom. "</p>
          <p>Some of Shanak's books are:</p>
          <list>
            <item n="1"> "On Poisons," five articles, translated from Indian into Persian by Manka
              the Indian. The one to set it down in Persian was Abū Hatam al-Balkhi, who translated
              it for Yaḥyā b. Khalīd b. Balmak. It was then transcribed for al-Ma'amun by ʿAbbas b.
              Saʿīd al-Jawhārī, his teacher, who supervised its reading to al-Ma'amun.</item>

          <p> A wise dignitary, one of the outstanding scholars of his time, this man showed insight
            in medicine and philosophy. One of his books is "On Biology," which has been translated
            into Arabic.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head><persName>Manka.</persName></head>
          <p> A competent, resourceful physician, and a philosopher, held up as a model in India. He
            was well-versed in Indian and Persian, and it is he who translated Shanak's book on
            poisons. He lived during Harun al-Rashīd's caliphate. He traveled from India to Iraq,
            where he met and treated al-Rashīd.</p>
          <p>I have read somewhere that Manka was among the group of Isḥāq b. Sulayman b. ʿAlī, the
            Hashemite. He translated from Indian into Persian and Arabic. <pb n="603" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>In the book "Of Caliphates and Barmakids" I have read that al-Rashīd contracted a
            serious disease and was treated by physicians to no avail. Abū ʿUmar al-ʿHjami said:
            "There is a physician in India called Manka who is a philosopher too. If the Emir of the
            Faithful were to send for him, maybe he would be inspired to find a cure. " Al-Rashīd
            sent a messenger to him with a gift to enable him to make the journey. Manka came and
            treated the Caliph successfully, and al-Rashīd showered him with money and gifts.</p>
          <p>When Manka was passing by al-Khuld, he came upon a man who had spread his cloak out on
            the ground and was displaying many drugs on it. He asked him about one of the drugs, and
            received the answer that it was for the fever that recurs every second day, for the
            fever which recurs every fourth day, for backache, knee-ache, hemorrhoids, gas pains,
            aching joints, eye irritation, stomachache, headache, migraine, for distilling urine,
            and for ague — indeed, he did not omit a single malady for which he did not prescribe
            this drug. Manka said to his interpreter: "What does he say?" The man translated the
            above words, and Manka smiled, saying: "At any rate, the King of the Arabs is an
            ignorant man. If what this fellow says is true, why did the Caliph have to bring me from
            my country, estrange me from my people, and bear the expense of lodging and feeding me,
            while he could have found what he needed here under his very nose! And if it is not
            true, why does he not have him killed? The law endorses the killing of his like, because
            if he were put to death, it would be only one soul lost but many saved, whereas if he
            were left alive, his ignorance would kill a man a day — quite probably two, three, or
            four a day. This is a sin against religion and an evil committed against the
            kingdom."</p>

          <head><persName>Saleh b. Bahlah,</persName></head>
          <p> an outstanding savant, well-versed in medical treatment, was highly influential and
            did much to promote knowledge. He was in Iraq during Harun al-Rashīd's reign. <pb
              n="604" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>Abū Hassan Yūsuf al-Haseb, known as Ibn al-Dayah, said that Aḥmad b. Rashīd al-Qatib,
            patron of Salam al-Abrash, related to him that his master had told him as follows: "One
            day, tables were set for al-Rashīd when Jibrā'īl b. Bakhtishūʿ was absent. Abrash said
            to me that Abū Salma, meaning his master, said the Emir of the Faithful ordered him to
            ask Jibrā'īl to attend the meal as usual. He searched in every house where he might have
            been but could not find him. He reported this to the Emir, and while the latter was
            cursing, Jibrā'īl entered, and said to the Emir: 'It would have been more fitting if the
            Emir of the Faithful had occupied himself in weeping for his cousin, Ibrāhīm b. Saleh,
            instead of cursing me.' Al-Rashīd asked what was wrong with Ibrāhīm, and Jibrā'īl told
            him that he had left him with enough breath left to recite the evening prayer.
            Al-Rashīd's grief was so intense that he began to weep. He ordered the tables to be
            removed, and his sorrow mounted until all present felt pity for him.</p>
          <p>"Jaʿafar b. Yaḥyā said: 'O, Emir of the Faithful, Jibrā'īl's medicine is Roman
            medicine. And Saleh b. Bahlah the Indian in his knowledge of the ways of the Indian
            people in medicine is like Jibrā'īl in his knowledge of the Roman methods. Maybe the
            Emir would care to summon him and send him to his cousin, so that we may learn from him
            what Jibrā'īl has told us.' The Caliph agreed and ordered Jaʿafar to take him to the
            sick man and then bring him back. Jaʿafar did so, and Saleh went to Ibrāhīm and examined
            his pulse. Then he went to Jaʿafar, who asked him what he had found. He answered: 'I
            will tell only the Emir of the Faithful' Jaʿafar did his best to persuade the Physician
            to give him some information, but without success. Jaʿafar went to al-Rashīd, announcing
            Saleh's presence, and told him that the doctor had refused to divulge his diagnosis.
            Al-Rashīd ordered Saleh to be brought in to him. The physician entered and said: 'O,
            Emir of the Faithful, you are the Imam, the bestower of authority on rulers, <pb n="605"
              ed="kopf"/> whatever you decree, no judge can revoke. You and all who are present are
            hereby witnesses to my statement that if Ibrāhīm b. Saleh dies tonight, or of his
            present malady, all that belongs to Saleh b. Bahiah may be taken from him. Every animal
            may be given to the needy, all his money should be donated to the poor, and all his
            wives shall be thrice divorced according to the laws of Islam.' Al-Rashīd said to him:
            'Woe unto you, you have sworn about the unknown!' Saleh replied: 'No, Emir of the
            Faithful. The unknown is that of which no one has an inkling. I only say what is clear
            to me from reliable indications. Al-Rashīd appeared relieved by these words. He began to
            eat and drink. When it was time for the evening prayer, a note came from Baghdad,
            announcing the death of Ibrāhīm b. Saleh. Al-Rashīd turned to Jaʿafar and blamed him
            bitterly for having recommended Saleh b. Bahiah. He cursed India and its physicians,
            exclaiming: Shame on me in the eyes of God that I was drinking while my cousin lay on
            his deathbed!' Then he ordered a bottle of wine and water to be brought, into which he
            put some salt. He drank and vomited all the food and drink that was in his stomach. He
            left for Ibrāhīm's house, where servants led him to a hall off which the dead man lay.
            To the right and left were two mattresses with comfortable chairs padded and cushioned.
            Al-Rashīd leaned on his sword and, standing, said: 'At the loss of a beloved kinsman one
            should not sit on more than mats. Remove all these mattresses and cushions!' The
            servants did so, and al-Rashīd sat on the mat. This became henceforth a custom among the
            Abbasids.</p>
          <p>"Saleh b. Bahiah came before al-Rashīd. No one spoke to him until the smell rose from
            the burning cinders. At that moment, Saleh shouted: 'Allāh, Allāh, O, Emir of the
            Faithful, if you order me to divorce my wife and take her, give her to someone else, who
            does not fulfill the religious requirements, so that I can be her legal husband <pb
              n="606" ed="kopf"/> again. By Allāh, if you take my money away from me, while I have
            uttered no untruth, you will be burying your consin alive. For as Allāh is my witness,
            he is not dead. Allow me to go in and look at him.' He repeated these words over and
            over, until he was eventually granted permission.</p>
          <p>"We began to hear the sound of a hand beating on a body. Then this stopped, and we
            heard: Allāh is great! Saleh emerged, repeating this phrase, and said: 'O, Emir of the
            Faithful, come with me and I will show you a miracle.' Al-Rashid, Masrour the Great, Abū
            Salem and I accompanied him. Saleh took Ibrāhīm's hand, produced a needle, and inserted
            it between the left thumbnail and the flesh. Then Ibrāhīm drew his hand to his body and
            Saleh said: 'O, Emir of the Faithful, does a corpse feel pain?' Al-Rashfd said: 'No,'
            and Saleh continued: 'If you wish him to speak to you now, he will do so.' The Caliph
            entreated that he speak, but Saleh objected: 'O Emir, I am afraid that if I treat him
            and he wakes up while he is dressed in a shroud, with the smell of preservative, he will
            die of shock, and then I will have no way of bringing him back to life. But if you order
            the shroud to be removed and that Ibrāhīm be taken to the washing room, cleansed and
            dressed in his everyday clothes, perfumed with his usual perfume, and brought back to
            his own bedchamber, I will treat him in your presence, and he will speak to you
            directly.</p>
          <p>Aḥmad says that Abū Salma went on to say: "Al-Rashīd entrusted me to follow Saleh's
            instructions. Then, the Caliph, Masrour, Abū Salem, Saleh and I went to where Ibrāhīm
            lay. Saleh asked for bellows from the cupboard and started to apply them close to the
            sick man's nose for twenty minutes. The body shuddered, and the patient sneezed and then
            sat up before al-Rashīd. Ibrāhīm kissed his hand, and al-Rashīd asked what had happened
            to him. Ibrāhīm told him that he had slept so soundly that he did not re member
            anything, but <pb n="607" ed="kopf"/> he had dreamed that a dog was attacking him and
            that he had defended himself with his hand. It gave his left thumb such a bite that it
            woke him, and he now felt pain there. He indicated the thumb which Saleh had pricked
            with the needle."</p>
          <p>Ibrāhīm lived on for many years. He married al-Abbassa, the daughter of al-Mahdi. He
            became the ruler of Egypt and Palestine. His death occurred in Egypt, where his tomb is
            to be found.<pb n="608" ed="kopf"/></p>

        <div>
          <head><persName>Isḥāq b. ʿImrān</persName></head>
          <p>, a renowned physician and scholar, was surnamed "Samm Sāʿa" [i.e. instantly killing
            poison]. Sulaymān b. Hasan — known as Ibn Juljul — said: "Isḥāq b. ʿImrān was a Muslim
            of Baghdādi origin. He went to Ifriqiya during the reign of Ziyādat Allāh b. al-Aghlab
            al-Tamīmī, who had invited him. Before Isḥāq started on his journey, Ibn al-Aghlab, in
            fulfillment of conditions set by him, sent him a riding animal, one thousand dinars for
            his expenses and a written pledge, in his own hand, assuring him of permission to return
            to his homeland whenever he wanted to; this pledge, however, was dishonored. Through
            Isḥāq, medicine was enhanced and philosopy inaugurated in the Maghrib. He was a skillful
            physician, an expert in the preparation of compound drugs and a competent diagnostician.
            In his knowledge and outstanding talents he resembled the ancients.</p>
          <p>He settled in Qairawān for a time and wrote some books, including the following:</p>
          <list>
            <item n="1"> "Recreation of the Soul."</item>
            <item n="2"> A book on melancholy, the like of which had never been written.</item>
            <item n="3"> A book on bloodletting.</item>
            <item n="4"> A book on the pulse.  <pb n="609" ed="kopf"/>
            </item>
          </list>
          <p>A quarrel with Ziyādat Allāh b. al-Aghlab led to an estrangement between the two, so
            that Ibn al-Aghlab eventually had him crucified. Isḥāq had asked permission to return to
            Baghdād, but Ibn al-Aghlab had declined this request.</p>
          <p>Isḥāq was present at Ibn al-Aghlab's meals and would tell him: "Eat this and abstain
            from that." [This went on] until a Jewish youth from Spain came to the court of Ibn
            al-Aghlab, who made him his intimate friend and allowed him to be present at his meals.
            Whenever Isḥāq said to Ibn al-Aghlab: "Leave this, do not eat it," the Israelite
            interjected: "He treats you hard."</p>
          <p>Ibn al-Aghlab suffered from asthma. Once, when some suspicious-looking milk was served
            to him, Isḥāq warned him not to drink it, but the Israelite encouraged him to do so. He
            followed the advice of the latter. At night, he had an attack of asthma so violent that
            he almost died. Isḥāq was sent for and asked: "Do you know of any remedy? " He replied:
            "I dissuaded him but he would not listen to me; I have no remedy." Whereupon he was
            told: "Take these 500 mithkāl and treat him." But he declined until the sum was raised
            to 1,000 mithkāl. Having taken the money, he asked for some snow. When it was brought,
            he requested Ibn al-Aghlab to eat of it until he was full, and then made him vomit;
            whereupon all the milk, which the snow had caused to coagulate came out. Isḥāq then
            said: "O Emir, it that milk had entered your bronchi and stuck to them, you would have
            choked to death, but I pressed it hard and forced it out before it reached the lungs."
            Said Ziyādat Allāh: "Isḥāq has sold my life by auction; stop his allowance."</p>
          <p>Thus deprived of his livelihood, Isḥāq went to an empty lot in one of the public
            squares of Qairawān, where he equipped himself with a chair, and inkstand and some paper
            and began to write prescriptions every day for a fee. When someone said to Ziyādat
            Allāh: "You have made Isḥāq rich!" he ordered him to be put in prison; <pb n="610"
              ed="kopf"/> however, the people followed him there, and so he took him out at night
            and removed him to his residence, where he was treated by him to such stories and
            remonstrances as because of his despotic nature and feeble mind drove him to a fury;
            wherefore he had him bled on both arms at the same time, until he died from loss of
            blood. Thereafter he had him crucified and left in this condition for a long time, until

          <p>That night, he said to Ziyādat Allāh, among other things: "You are called Lord of the
            Arabs, but you are not their lord. A long time ago, I had you swallow a drug that will
            surely affect your mind." Ziyādat Allāh was a lunatic; he fell into melancholia and
            died.</p>

          <p> was an outstanding physician, a savant renowned for his skill and knowledge, an
            excellent writer and a man of far-reaching aspirations. He was surnamed Abū Yaʿqūb but
            became generally knows by the name al-Isrā'īlī. A native of Egypt, where he started his
            career as an oculist, he later went to Qairawān, where he attached himself to Isḥāq b.
            ʿImrān and became his pupil. He entered the service of the Imam Abū Muḥammad ʿUbayd
            Allāh b. al-Mahdī, the ruler of Ifrīqiya, as a physician. In addition to having an
            excellent knowledge of medicine, he was well-versed in logic and a number of other
            disciplines. He lived for more than a hundred years, but never took a wife or begot
            offspring.</p>
          <p>Asked whether he would be happy to have children, he said— "Not if I live to finish the
            'Book of Fevers,'" meaning to say that the "Book of Fevers" would preserve his memory
            much more effectively than offspring would. He is also reported to have said: "I have
            written four books that are better able to perpetuate my memory than children, namely
            the 'Book of Fevers,' the 'Book of Food and Medicaments,' the 'Book of Urine' and the
            'Book of Elements.' " He died around the year 320/932.</p>
          <p>Here is what Aḥmad b. Ibrāhīm b. Abī Khālid, known as Ibn al-Jazzār, says in his
            "History of the Dynasty," which deals with the commencement in the Maghrib, of the rule
            of the Imām Abū Muḥammad ʿUbayd Allāh al-Mahdī: Isḥāq b. Sulaymān, the physician, told
            me: On arriving from Egypt to visit Ziyādat Allāh b. al-Aghlab, I learnt <pb n="612"
              ed="kopf"/> that he was with his army at Laribus. He sent an escort to fetch me (he
            had previously sent me 500 dinars, which had enabled me to undertake the journey from
            Egypt). So I journeyed to him, and as soon as I arrived, I was admitted to his presence.
            I saluted him as is due to an Emir and paid homage to him as one should to a king, but I
            realized that his court lacked dignity and that the love of pleasantry was its dominant
            feature.</p>
          <p>"Ibn Khanbash, known as al-Yūnānī [the Greek], opened the conversation with me by
            asking: 'Is it your opinion that salty things purge?' When I replied in the affirmative,
            he continued: 'And do you think that sweet things purge?' I said yes, and he said: 'So
            the sweet and salty are alike.' I retorted: 'Sweet things purge gently and pleasantly,
            and salty things purge vehemently.' But he persevered, trying to trip me up. Realizing
            this, I asked him: 'Do you think that you are a living being and that a dog is a living
            being?' When he said he did, I continued: 'So you are like a dog and a dog is like you.'
            Thereupon Ziyādat Allāh went into fits of laughter, and so I learnt that his love for
            pleasantry was greater than his love for serious thought."</p>

          <p>Said Isḥāq: "When Abū ʿAbdallāh, the missionary of al-Mahdī, came to Rakkada, he sought
            my acquaintance and made me his confidant. He had a stone in his kidneys, and I treated
            him with a medicine containing burnt scorpions. One day I was sitting with a group of
            men from [the tribe of] Kutāma, who questioned me about various diseases, but whatever I
            answered they did not grasp my meaning. So I said to them: 'You are [like] cattle and
            have nothing in common with humans except the name.' This incident was reported to Abū
            ʿAbdallāh, and when I [next] called on him he said: 'You treat our Muslim brethren from
            Kutāma improperly. By Allāh the Generous, were it not that you might plead ignorance of
            their merits and great knowledge of [religious] truth, I would surely cut off your head.
            I had to do with a man who took every day seriously and had no sense of humor.'" <pb

          <p> Abū Jaʿfar Aḥmad b. Ibrāhīm b. Abī Khālid, known as Ibn al-Jazzār was a nature of
            Qairawān. He was a physician, as were his father and paternal uncle, Abū Bakr. He became
            acquainted with Isḥāq b. Sulaymān, attached himself to him and became his student. Ibn
            al-Jazzār was endowed with a good memory and a craving for knowledge. He studied
            medicine and other sciences and showed a fine grasp of them.</p>
          <p>Sulaymān b. Hasan, known as Ibn Juljul, says: "Aḥmad b. Abī Khālid adopted admirable
            rules as to appearance, behavior and deportment, and no one in Qairawān remembered him
            ever to have committed a faux pas or to have indulged in sensual pleasures. He attended
            funerals and wedding feasts, but never ate on such occasions. <pb n="614" ed="kopf"/> He
            never went on horseback when calling on one of the dignitaries of Ifrrqiya or on its
            ruler, but only when visiting Abū Tālib, the paternal uncle of Maʿadd, who was an old
            friend of his; he rode to his house on Fridays only. Every year he retired to a Sufī
            hospice [?] on the Mediterranean coast near Monastīr, a place of devotional seclusion,
            famous for its blessings and historical associations. There he would spend the hot
            summer days, subsequently returning to Ifrīqiya.</p>
          <p>"Next to the outside door of his house he built a roofed lobby, in which he placed one
            of his servants, called Rashiq. The latter had before him all kinds of electuaries,
            liquid medicines and drugs. After examining the phials [of urine] in the morning, Ibn
            al-Jazzār told his patients to go to his servant and receive medicaments from him. [He
            did so) because he was too proud to take payment from anyone."</p>
          <p>Ibn Juljul says: "A reliable informant told me the following about Ibn al-Jazzār: 'I
            was once in his vestibule, which was packed with people, when the nephew of the Qādi
            al-Nuʿmān suddenly appeared. This was a youth who enjoyed great prestige in Ifrīqiya;
            the Qādi had him deputize for him whenever he was for some reason prevented from sitting
            in court.</p>
          <p>He found no place to sit in the vestibule, except the one reserved for Abū Jaʿfar [Ibn
            al-Jazzār] himself. When Abū Jaʿfar appeared, the Qādī's nephew vacated the seat for
            him, but Abū Jaʿfar neither asked him to sit down again nor bade him welcome. The youth
            showed him a phial he had brought with him, which contained urine of his cousin, a son
            of al-Nuʿmān and, still standing, received from him a detailed account of the findings.
            Then he rode away without being annoyed at the way he had been treated. He returned
            every day, bringing urine, until the patient was cured.' My informant continued: 'I was
            with b. al-Jazzār when a messenger of al-Nuʿmān, the Qadī, arrived with a letter in
            which he thanked him for the trouble he had taken in curing his son. The messenger also
            brought headgear and 300 mithkals. Ibn al-Jazzār read the letter and prepared a reply,
              <pb n="615" ed="kopf"/> thanking al-Nuʿmān in return, but accepted neither the money
            nor the headgear. I thereupon remarked to him: 'These are blessings that Allāh has
            bestowed upon you.' He replied: 'By Allāh, Maʿadd's men shall never boast of having done
            me a favor!'"</p>
          <p>Aḥmad b. al-Jazzār lived for more than eighty years and died, still in his prime, in
            Qairawān. In his estate were found 24,000 dinars and 25 hundredweight of medical and
            other books. He had intended to travel to Spain but had not carried out his plan. He
            lived during the reign of Maʿadd.</p>
          <p>Eulogizing Abū Jaʿfar Aḥmad b. al-Jazzār, with special reference to his book "Zād
            al-Musāfir" (Provisions for the Traveler), Kusahjim said:</p>
          <quote><p><l>O Abū Jaʿfar, you performed, both in life and in death, </l><l> Glorious

          <p> known as al-Majrītī [the Madritenian], a native of Cordoba, lived in the days of

            Andalusian mathematician of his time, had a better knowledge of astronomy than his
            predecessors, engaged in the observation of stars and ardently applied himself to the
            study of Ptolemy's "Almagest." He wrote a book on the improvement of what we call
            commercial arithmetic and another epitomizing that part of al-Battānī's 'Astronomical
            Tables,' which deals with the equation of planets. He revised the Astronomical Tables of
            Muḥammad b. Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, substituting the Arab era for the Persian and fixing the
            [?] of the planets to the beginning of the Islamic era. Though adding useful charts to
            al-Khwārizmī's work, he repeated that author's errors without comment. I called
            attention to this in my book on the rectification [of our knowledge] of the movements of

            geometry — in the solution of its problems, the clarification of its difficulties or in

            On his return to Andalusia, he settled in Saragossa, on the border of the then Muslim
            territory. He brought with him what were known as 'The Epistles of the Sincere
            Brethren,' which, to our knowledge, no one had introduced into Andalusia before. He also
            took up medicine, making valuable observations in this field and attaining remarkable
            skill in cauterization, amputation, incisions, ablations and other operations. But he
            was ignorant of astronomy and logic; this I was told by Abū 'l-Fadl Hasday b. Yūsuf b.

            to Andalusia an electuary for stomach pains, one dose of which he would sell for 50
            dinars. In this way he made a fortune. One day, five physicians, including Hamdīn and
            Jawād, joined hands, collected 50 dinars and bought a dose of the said medicament from
            al-Harrānī. Each of them took a fraction of it, sniffed at it, tasted it and noted down
            what he had perceived with his senses. Thereafter they assembled, agreed upon their
            findings and drew them up in writing. Then they went to see al-Harrānī and said to him:
            Allāh has let you profit from that medicament, which is your exclusive property, and we
            have bought one dose from you, examined it and came to such and such conclusions. If the
            results we arrived at are correct, it is all right; if not, let us share the knowledge
            of that medicament, for you have already drawn great profit from it. ' He perused their
            written account and then said: 'You have not left out any of the ingredients, but you
            are mistaken as to the proportions.' The medicament concerned is the one known as the
            "Great Helper." Al-Harrānī told them its composition, and since then it has become

          <p>These men traveled to the East in the year 330/941, during the reign of al-Nāsir, and
            stayed there for ten years. They came to Baghdad, where they studied the writings of
            Galen under the guidance of Thābit b. Sinān b. Thābit b. Qurra the Sabiān and assisted
            Ibn Wasīf in the treatment of eye diseases. In the year 351 /962, during the reign of
            al-Mustansir bi-Allāh, they returned to Andalusia and, in that and the following year,
            took part in the military expeditions of al-Mustansir. Thereafter the Caliph attached
            them to his medical service, had them live in the City of al-Zahrāʿ and chose them, in
            preference to all other physicians of the time, as his personal attendants.</p>
          <p>ʿUmar died of a tumor of the stomach — he had become so emaciated from it that he could
            not survive. So Aḥmad alone remained as court physician. Al-Mustansir had him live at
            his palace in al-Zahrāʿ, showed him great favor and trusted him so much that he granted
            him access to his children and womenfolk. Aḥmad was a mild-tempered person, endowed with
            a sound intellect, who perfectly understood the treatment of the diseases which he had
            studied in the East. He was al-Mustansir's favorite because the Caliph was a glutton and
            often suffered from indigestion owing to the huge quantities of food he consumed; Aḥmad
            prepared strong pills [?] for him which did him much good, and so the physician was
            richly rewarded for his services.</p>
          <p>Aḥmad stammered and possessed a clumsy handwriting, being unable even to shape the
            letters correctly. He was an expert in simple drugs, manufactured liquid medicines and
            electuaries and cured any illness he came across. </p>
          <p>Ibn Juljul says: "I saw him employ twelve Slav boys in concocting liquid medicines and
            preparing electuaries under his supervision. He asked permission of the Emir of the
            Faithful, al-Mustansir, to give some of his preparations to poor, sick persons who were
            in need of them; and he was granted that permission. Stories were <pb n="624" ed="kopf"

          <p>Ibn Juljul says: "A trustworthy person told me the following story about Yaḥyā b.
            Isḥāq. He — my informant — had a young slave who had formerly belonged to the
            Chamberlain Mūsā or the Vizier ʿAbd al-Malik. That slave related the following to him:
            'My master once sent me to the Vizier Yaḥyā b. Isḥāq to deliver a letter, and while I
            was sitting in front of his house, near the Nut Gate, a Beduin approached on a donkey,
            crying. He stopped at the entrance to the house and said entreatingly: Have mercy upon
            me and tell the Vizier of my arrival. <pb n="625" ed="kopf"/> At that moment, the
            Vizier, who had heard the man crying, appeared with the reply to the letter in his hand.
            He said to the man: What ails you? and the man replied: I have a swelling in my urethra
            which has prevented me from urinating these many days; I will surely die. Yaḥyā asked to
            see the man's penis and, on looking at it, found it indeed to be swollen. He then said
            to a man who had come with the patient: Fetch me a smooth stone. When the man had
            brought such a stone, he said to him: Put it on your palm and place the penis on it.
            When the penis lay firmly on the stone, the Vizier clenched his fist and struck the
            penis so violently that the man fainted. Then the pus gushed forth, and before all of it
            had come out, the patient opened his eyes and voided urine. Yaḥyā then said to him: You
            may go now, for you have been cured. But you are a wicked man; you practiced sodomy with
            a beast and came upon a grain of barley which stuck to the opening of your urethra and
            caused the swelling. This grain came out with the pus. The man admitted having done as
            Yaḥyā said. This story points to the sound intuition and remarkable and unfailing
            sagacity on Yaḥyā's part.'"</p>
          <p>Ibn Juljul continued: "There is an interesting report of a cure which Yaḥyā applied to
            al-Nāsir. When the Vizier was prefect of Badajoz, al-Nāsir was afflicted with earache.
            He underwent treatment, but the pains did not subside. So he sent for Yaḥyā. When the
            messenger arrived, Yaḥyā asked him why he had been sent, and he replied: 'The Emir of
            the Faithful is suffering from pain in his ears, and the physicians are at a loss what
            to do about it.' On his way to al-Nāsir, Yaḥyā stopped at a Christian monastery and
            inquired whether there was any savant there. He found an old man and asked him: ' Do you
            know of any well-tried medicine for earache?' The old monk replied: 'Blood of pigeons
            while still warm.' On reaching the residence of the Emir of the Faithful. Yaḥyā treated
            him with the warm blood of freshly slaughtered pigeons, and al-Nāsir was <pb n="626"

            Shunaif, the postmaster, for asthma with a certain electuary; the patient recovered the
            same day, after the other physicians had been unable to cure him. For pain in the loins
            he used certain pills which he prepared himself and which acted immediately. He always

          <p> i. e., Abū Dā'ūd Sulaymān b. Hasan, known as Ibn Juljul, was a distinguished
            physician. An expert therapist, he displayed remarkable versatility in his profession.
            He lived in the days of Hishām al-Muʿayyad bi-Allāh whom he served as physician. He was
            well acquainted with the properties of simple drugs.</p>
          <p>He explained the names of the simple drugs occurring in the book of Dioscorides of
            Anazarba. At the beginning of his book on this subject he himself says: <pb n="633"
              ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>'Dioscorides book was translated from Greek into Arabic in Baghdād in the Abbasid era
            during the reign of Jaʿfar al-Mutawakkil, by Stephen, the son of Basil, the interpreter.
            Hunayn b. Isḥāq, the translator, corrected the text and approved it. Stephen translated
            into Arabic those Greek names for which he knew an Arabic equivalent, while leaving in
            the Greek original those for which he did not know an Arabic term, hoping that Allāh
            would later send someone equipped with the necessary knowledge to be able to translate
            them into Arabic, for nomenclature is but a matter of convention among the people of the
            country concerned, who agree to denote the different kinds of drugs as seems best to
            them — either by a derivative word or by any other means fixed by common consent.
            Stephen trusted that he would be succeeded by others who would know the drugs for which
            he did not know a name and would name them in accordance with the state of knowledge at
            their time, so that the names would become generally known.</p>
          <p>"That book was circulated in Andalusia as translated by Stephen, containing the Arabic
            names which the translator knew and the original Greek names for which he knew no
            corresponding Arabic terms It was utilized as far as the terms employed were
            intelligible according to the usage prevalent in the East and in Andalusia. This state
            of affairs continued until al-Nāsir ʿAbd al-Raḥmān became ruler of Andalusia. Romanus,
            Emperor of Constantinople, sent him a message — I think it was in the year 337/948 and
            presented him with gifts of great value, including the book of Dioscorides, with
            pictures of herbs in the marvellous Byzantine style and written in the Greek language.
            Romanus also sent the book of Orosius, the author of 'Tales,' which is an outstanding
            historical account of the Byzantines, containing stories about ancient kings and a great
            deal of useful information. Romanus wrote in his letter to al-Nāsir: 'Dioscorides' book
            cannot be utilized except with the help of a person who knows Greek well and is
            acquainted with the drugs concerned. <pb n="634" ed="kopf"/> If there is someone in your
            country equipped with the necessary knowledge, you will, O king, derive great profit
            from the book. As to Orosius' work, you probably have in your country, among the Roman
            population, some people who read Latin, and if you submit the book to them they will
            translate it for you into Arabic.'</p>
          <p>"At that time, no Andalusian Christian in Cordoba was able to read Greek. So the Greek
            original of Dioscorides' book remained in ʿAbd al Raḥman al-Nāsir's library without
            being translated into Arabic. The people of Andalusia continued to use Stephen's
            translation, which had been brought from Baghdad.</p>
          <p>"In his reply al-Nāsir asked the Emperor Romanus to send him a man who knew Greek and
            Latin and who might teach some of his slaves, who in turn would become translators. So
            the Emperor sent a monk named Nicholas, who arrived in Cordoba in the year 340/951. At
            that time, some physicians in Cordoba were engaged in painstaking research with a view
            to translating into Arabic the names of those drugs occurring in Dioscorides' book,
            which had not been understood. The one who most eagerly applied himself to this pursuit,
            with a view to ingratiating himself with King ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Nāsir, was Hasday b.
            Shaprut [sic], the Israelite. Nicholas the Monk, who became his favorite and close
            friend, explained to him those obscure names of drugs. Moreover, Nicholas was the first
            in Cordoba to prepare the theriac called al-Fārūq from purely vegetal ingredients [?].
            The physicians who, at that time, tried to establish the meanings of the names used by
            Dioscorides and to identify the drugs themselves included Muḥammad, known as al-Shajjār
            [the herbalist]; a man known as al-Basbāsī; Abū ʿUthmān al-Hazzāz, surnamed al-Yābisī;
            Muḥammad b. Saʿīd, the physician; ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Isḥāq b. Haitham, and Abū ʿAbd Allāh
            al-Sikillī [the Sicilian], who spoke Greek and was acquainted with the drugs from
            personal observation. All these were contemporaries of Nicholas the Monk, and I saw them
            as well as Nicholas and became acquainted with them in the <pb n="635" ed="kopf"/> days
            of al-Mustansir al-Hakam. At the beginning of the reign of this ruler, Nicholas died.
            Thanks to the efforts of those persons, it became possible, in Cordoba alone of the
            whole of Andalusia, to identify those drugs in a way precluding all doubt, resulting
            from direct knowledge of the drugs themselves. The correct pronunciation of the names
            was also established. There remained only a few drugs —about ten — of minor importance
            that could not be identified.</p>
          <p>"I tried hard to ascertain the primary medicinal substance, the substance which is the
            basis of compound drugs. At last Allāh, in His mercy, granted me such insight that I hit
            on it. It was my intention to preserve what I feared might become obliterated and the
            benefit of which might be lost to mankind; for Allāh has created healing, spreading it
            in what the land brings forth in the animals that live on the earth — whether walking,
            swimming or creeping — and in the minerals hidden underground. In all these there is
            healing, divine grace and benevolence."</p>

          <p>The judge Sāʿid said: "He specialized in the field of simple drugs until he had a more
            detailed and exact knowledge than any of his contemporaries. He composed a remarkably
            well ordered book on this subject in which he compiled the relevant information
            contained in Dioscorides and Galen. He organized his work in the best way possible. He
            told me it had taken him about twenty years to collect the material and put it in order,
            to verify the names and qualities of the medicaments, including details of their powers
            and strength, before he himself considered it satisfactorily and complete. He had a
            subtle conception and a sound technique in medicine, both of which were expressed in his
            belief that drugs should not be used when it is sufficient to have recourse to an
            alimentary regime or the like. If it was absolutely necessary to employ drugs, he did
            not use compound ones before trying the simples. If he was forced to use the compound
            drugs, he restricted himself to as small dosages as possible.</p>
          <p>"His way of curing serious maladies and dread diseases by the simplest and gentlest
            treatments was renowned as extraordinary, and long remembered as miraculous. He lived in
            Toledo in the days of Ibn Dhū al-Nūn. He was born in Dhū al-Hijja 387/997 and was still

            He was a Jewish Rabbi, well-informed in religious law, and the first to show the Jews of

            religious law, their calendar, and the dates of their festivals. They used to receive
            from them calculations for several years, so as to know thereby the calendrical data.

          <p> Yūsuf b. Aḥmad b. Hasday was a remarkable physician, who devoted himself ardently to
            the study and comprehension of the books of Hippocrates and Galen. He traveled from
            Spain to the land of Egypt and became very famous there, distinguishing himself in the
            days of al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allāh, one of the caliphs of Egypt. He was an intimate friend
            of al-Mamun, i.e., Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad b. Nūr al-Dawlah Abi Shujjāʿ al-Āmirī, as
            long as the latter was holding the reins of government. He exercised this power during
            three years and nine months, since al-Amir made him his vizier on the 5th of Dhu
            al-Hijja 515/1121. He was arrested on a Saturday night, the 11th of Ramadan 519/1125, in
            the palace after the evening prayer, and was subsequently put to death in the month of
            Rajāb 522/1128 and crucified on the outskirts of Cairo.</p>
          <p>During his tenure of office, al-Maʿmūn was full of dignity and displayed a keen
            interest in the sciences. He ordered Yūsuf b. Aḥmad b. Hasday to write a commentary on
            Hippocrates' books for him, these being the most important, works in the medical
            science, the most profitable and also the most difficult, and Ibn Hasday started working
            on this task. I have seen a commentary to Hippocrates' "Book of Oaths" written by him,
            in which he gave an excellent explanation and interpreted the subject matter
            superlatively. I have also come across a commentary by him to a part of Hippocrates'
            "Book of Aphorisms." He had strong ties of friendship with Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. Yaḥyā,
            also known as Ibn Bajja, with whom he corresponded regularly from Cairo. Yūsuf b. Aḥmad
            b. Hasday was addicted to drink and was fond of pleasantries and anecdotes. <pb n="642"
              ed="kopf"/>
          </p>

          <p>I was told about him, that when he was on the road from Alexandria to Cairo he made
            friends with a sūfī. They struck up a conversation and became attached to each other. As
            they were nearing Cairo, the sūfi asked him: "Where are you staying in Cairo, so that I
            can visit you?" He answered: I was thinking of going to the tavern to drink, so if you
            would like to see me there, that is up to you!" These words offended the sūfī, he
            disapproved of this attitude and retreated. A few days later, when Ibn Hasday was in the
            market, he suddenly caught sight of a group of people with a sūfī in their midst, being
            severely punished after a rumor had spread that he had been found drunk. When the sūfī
            approached b. Hasday's place, he looked upon him and recognized him; Ibn Hasday said:
            "By Allāh, Your false devotion has killed you."</p>

            following. A vessel loaded with copper had arrived in Alexandria and was wrecked close
            by. Nobody could think of a way of raising her because of her lying too deep, but Abū
            al-Salt pondered deeply on this matter until he hit upon a solution. He went to al-Afdal
            b. Amīr al-Juyush, who was the governor of Alexandria, and informed him that he could
            raise the vessel from the sea bottom and refloat her with her load on condition that all
            the apparatus he might need for this would be made available to him. The governor,
            astonished by his plan and very happy about it, begged him to carry it out and supplied
            him with all the required instruments in addition to a sum of money. When everything was
            ready, Abū al-Salt loaded it all on a large vessel, similar to the one which had sunk.
            He attached silken hawsers to it and asked a group of expert sailors to dive and to tie
            the hawers firmly to the sunken ship. Previously he had built several engines to lift
            weights on ships, and now he showed the sailors how to operate them. While they were
            working, lo! The silken hawsers rose toward them little by little and were wound up on
            the drums between their hands, until the sunken ship appeared close to the surface. But
            at that moment the hawsers broke, and the vessel sank back to the bottom of the sea. Abū
            al-Salt had been very exact in his plan and in its realization but providence did not
            help him. The governor was angry with him because of the money wasted on the lost
            intruments, and unjustly ordered his arrest.</p>
          <p>Abū al-Salt remained in prison for a period, until he was freed through the
            intervention of some of the city fathers who had pity on him. All this happened during
            the Caliphate of al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allāh and the Vizierate of al-Malik al-Afdal b. Amīr
            al-Juyūsh. <pb n="646" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>I have copied the following from the correspondence of the Shaykh Abū al-Qāsim ʿAlī b.
            Sulaymān, known as Ibn al-Sairafī, who reported: "I received a note from the Sahikh Abū
            al-Salt while he was in prison, and at the end of it there were two poems in honor of
            al-Afdal's court."</p>
          <p>[Here he cites three parts of these poems and describes his overwhelming reaction to
            them, saying he will reread them many times and citing two verses approving his
            attitude, then he continues.]</p>
          <p>"I understand that you had resigned yourself to fate's decrees and had put up with the
            obstacles laid in the path of your free conduct, having faith in the good sentiments of
            the governor, may God prolong his days and favors, and knowing the general opinion about
            his generosity and nobleness. Another person who was similarily purged from doubt by
            God, who safeguarded his intention and good faith and assured his optimism and innocence
            by His providence, had said:"</p>
          <p>[Here he cites two verses, whose moral is: whatever the circumstances, do not
            despair!]</p>
          <p>"As to what is implied in your letter to the point that this misfortune was intended to
            abolish your past sins and diminish your faults — why, God had exempted you from sins
            and faults, and this was rather a test of your innermost faith and patience, the way he
            tested the pious believers and saintly men. Allāh the Exalted will, by His noble
            providence, destine your fate to be smooth and upright. I have met a person who informed
            me that he had by many efforts obtained a favorable promise as to the governors
            generosity. He is now awaiting a good opportunity to be exploited in mentioning you to
            the governor, May God Almighty help and direct him in his deeds. As to the two poems you
            have sent me, I know of nothing superior to them, from beginning to end, nothing more
            apt to reach the heart <pb n="647" ed="kopf"/> and ear, nothing more complete with
            ornament and beauty, nor with a more eloquent style, or with richer and better
            harmonized rhymes, considering the diversity and dissonance so prevalent in poetry. I
            found them more exquisite with each additional reading, and was delighted to think of
            the poem on liberation, which will follow those verses written in prison. May God the
            Omnipotent realize this hope of mine and precipitate my wish, for this would be my
            greatest happiness, if He so wishes."</p>
          <p>Abū al-Salt, God bless him, died on a Monday, the beginning of Muharram 529/1134, in
            Mahdia, and was buried in Monastir. On his death bed he pronounced some verses, which he
            ordered to be engraved on his tomb. [They are cited here, their themes being sin, mercy,
            and eternity.]</p>
          <p>When Abū al-Salt Umayya b. ʿAbd al-Azīz set out once more for Andalusia, he received in
            Mahdia a letter from Dhafir al-Haddad from Alexandria, addressed to Abū al-Salt from
            Egypt, in which he recalled their friendship and their stay together in Alexandria.</p>
          <p>[The poem on friendship, departure and hope is cited here in full. One interesting
            verse is: "My tears are forced out by a breath born between my clavicles and my
            ribs!"]</p>
          <p>Abū al-Salt himself composed a poem in honor of Aba Tāhir Yaḥyā b. Tamīm b. Muizz b.
            Badīs, in which he recalled the arrival of a Christian prince loaded with presents, who
            had asked for a cessation of hostilities in 505/1111.</p>
          <p>[Here he quotes the glorifying poem.]</p>
          <p>He also wrote a poem addressed to al-Afdal, telling about the army's march to Syria to
            combat the Crusaders, after its defeat in the place known as al-Hassa. In the meantime,
            a group of soldiers and other people decided to murder al-Afdal, but the latter
            discovered their plot and had them put to death. <pb n="648" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>

          <p>[A long and bloody poem follows about the omnipotence of the Muslim prince and his
            army, which are the glory of religion and mankind.]</p>
          <p>[Then a short poem is cited, on the beauty of woman, and another, describing the
            Pleiades. Afterwards, there are a few verses concerning Birkat al-Habash [the
            Abbyssinian lake] in Egypt; several sentimental verses, and a longer love poem. A short
            description of a gray horse is followed by advice to the wise ruler, then comes a
            declaration of love to a blonde; after this an assortment of rhymed sayings about love
            and friendship; a joke about fools who are full of scholarly ambitions; some moral
            conclusions on happiness, poverty and fate. His poem about fleas must be quoted from:
            "They are . . . wiser than Hippocrates in distinguishing the blood vessels, discerning
            between the median vein of the arm and the basilic vein for inserting their small
            lancet, and they have a more expert hand than the adroit and prudent doctor's." He
            speaks about disappointment from friends, about the astrolabe ['the best and
            unparalleled thing which has ever accompanied the cultivated man in his comings and
            goings ...']; and the censer. There follows a love poem; a poem regretting the sale of
            his house to a negro; a love poem to a youth; verses about fate; about work and faith
            and visiting friends.]</p>
          <p>He composed a poem about the physician Shaʿbān:</p>
          <quote><p><l>O physician who annoys and importunes the world: </l><l> There are two months
                of the passing year against you, </l><l> You are Shaʿbān, but you murder the people
                on Muharram. <pb n="649" ed="kopf"/>
              </l></p></quote>
          <p>[He talks about a critical moment in his life; about renouncing this world; about these
            bad times; another love poem; a poem inspired after he had seen a handsome youth giving
            his place to a negro; about his talents and fortune.] </p>

          <head><persName>Ibn Bājja,</persName></head>
          <p> i.e., Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. Yaḥyā b. al-Saʿigh, known as Ibn Bājja, from Andalusia. He
            was a guiding light in his time in the philosophical sciences, although his life was
            full of difficult moments, and the mob repeatedly threatened him with death, but Allāh
            rescued him. He distinguished himself in Arabic and literature, knew the Qur'ān by
            heart, and was considered one of the <pb n="650" ed="kopf"/> best physicians. He was
            proficient in music and playing the lute.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of his collection of Ibn Bājja's works, Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī b.
            ʿAbd-al-Azīz b. al-Imām, said something to this effect: "This is a collection of Abū
            Bakr b. al-Sāʿigh's — God's mercy be on him! — known works on philosophy. By his
            penetrating mind and profound knowledge of these noble and delicate problems, he is a
            prodigy and an extraordinary phenemenon of his time; for philosophical books were
            circulating in Andalusia from the days of al-Hakam, may Allāh brighten his countenance,
            who ordered them to be brought from the Orient, along with other wonderful works
            composed there or translated from the ancients."</p>
          <p>These books were read over and over but their readers did not fully understand them —
            they lapsed into error and haziness. This was the case with Ibn Hazm of Seville.
            Although he was one of the greatest savants of his time and best equipped to verify the
            results of his reasonings, Ibn Bājja was superior to him in acuteness of
            observation.</p>
          <p>The study of the above sciences was undertaken by Ibn Hazm and his contemporary, Mālik
            b. Wahaib of Seville, though all Mālik wrote on logic was a little about its preliminary
            concepts; he then abandoned this subject because of a blood feud and because of his
            tendency to verbosity. He turned to religious law, and reached almost top rank in it;
            however, his works on this subject are not remarkable for clarity, and no unpublished
            items were found after his death. As to Abū Bakr [Ibn Bājja], he distinguished himself
            by his strength of character; notwithstanding the difficulties of his life, he never
            ceased observing,analysing, and recording everything that impressed itself upon his
            kind. His achievements in logic and branches of the natural sciences attest to his
            perfect understanding of these two fields and to his mastery of details as well as of
            generalities. <pb n="651" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>He wrote commentaries on geometry and astronomy, proving his excellence in these
            subjects, while nothing in his notes deals exclusively with theology, except portions of
            the "Letter of Farewell" and the treatise "The Union of Man with the Active Intellect."
            There are only sporadic allusions to theology in his writings, but they are of great
            value in showing his preference for that noble science, which is the goal of all
            science, and for which all other knowledge is but a preparation. It is inconceivable
            that a man like him, who applied himself to the preparatory studies until all the
            aspects of existence were fully clear to him, should have failed in this science, which
            is the ultimate subject of all learning, natural to every orthodox person endowed with
            the power to surpass his contemporaries in rising from obscurity to light. Such a person
            was Ibn Bājja, may Allāh give him peace!</p>
          <p>The editor, Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī, says: "We open our collection with 'On the Human Goal,'
            a very carefully written treatise, showing Ibn Bājja's above-mentioned knowledge of
            theology and the preparatory disciplines; he may have written previously on that
            subject, but no such writing has been found. It seems that after Abū Nasr al-Fārābī no
            one equaled him in the subjects in question. For if we compare his writings with those
            of Ibn Sīnā and al-Ghazālī, the two who best understood and wrote about those sciences
            in the East after al-Fārābī, his superiority and comprehension of Aristotle's books
            becomes evident. The three of them are undoubtedly the best interpreters of their
            predecessors in these subjects; their writings and opinions agree with those of
            preceding generations."</p>
          <p>The above-quoted Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. al-Imām of Granada was a fine writer,
            distinguished in the sciences, a close friend of <pb n="652" ed="kopf"/> Ibn Bājja for a
            period, and his fellow student. He left the Māghrib and died in Cos. One of Ibn Bajjā's
            disciples was the judge Abū al-Walīd Muḥammad b. Rushd.</p>
          <p>Ibn Bājja died young in the town of Fez and was buried there. The judge Abū Marwān of
            Seville told me that he had seen his tomb, which is next to that of Abū Bakr b. al
            ʿArabī a jurist and author of many books.</p>
          <p>Examples of his sayings are: "That which one spends a long time studying one will not
            forget" and "Your good works are bound to be rewarded by God's blessings."</p>

          <p> i.e., Abū Marwān ʿAbd al-Malik, was the son of the jurist Muḥammad b. Marwān b. Zuhr
            al-Iyādī of Seville. He was a distinguished medical man, an excellent practitioner,
            celebrated for his keen wit. His father, Muḥammad, was one of the foremost jurists and
            experts in the Hadīth in Seville. The Judge Sāʿid reports that Abū Marwān traveled to
            the East, visiting Kairuan and Cairo, where he practiced medicine for a lengthy period,
            then returned to Andalusia and stayed in Denia in the days of the ruler Mujāhid. When he
            arrived there, the prince treated him with great <pb n="654" ed="kopf"/> distinction and
            asked him to remain with him, which he did. In Denia he achieved great wealth and the
            reputation of being a truly outstanding physician; his fame spread all over
            Andalusia.</p>
          <p>He held extraordinary views on medicine, such as his disapproval of hot baths, which he
            considered dangerous to the body and destructive of the composition of the humors.
            Comments the judge: "This opinion runs counter to both ancient and modern views, and
            both gentle and simple folk can testify to its wrongness. In fact, if its temperature is
            suitably graded, a hot bath is an excellent practice, for it opens the pores,
            facilitates evacuation and refines the digested food which has thickened." Shortly
            before his death, Abū Marwān moved from Denia to Seville. He left a large fortune,
            including much urban and rural property in Seville and the vicinity.</p>

          <p> i.e., Abū al-ʿAlā Zuhr b. Abū Marwān ʿAbd al-Malik b. Muḥammad b. Marwān. Noted for
            his keen wit and learning, he held some original views on therapeutics which show his
            medical genius and subtlety. There are anecdotes about his rare way of treating the
            sick, whose condition and pains he knew without questioning them, merely by looking at
            their urinal phials or feeling their pulse.</p>
          <p>He lived in the days of al-Mulattimūn [the veiled ones], otherwise known as the
            Almoravids, under whom he achieved wealth, fame and high rank.</p>
          <p>He practiced medicine while still very young, in the days of al-Muʿtadid bi-Allāh Abū
            ʿAmr ʿIbad b. ʿIbād. He also devoted himself to literature, being the author of some
            well-written books. It was in his lifetime that Ibn Sīnā's "Qānun" first reached the
            Occident. <pb n="655" ed="kopf"/> Ibn Jāmiʿ the Egyptian says in his book "Clarification
            of Some Obscure Points in the Qanūn," that a merchant brought a beautiful copy of the
            "Qanūn" from Iraq to Andalusia and gave it to Abū al-ʿAlā b. Zuhr, who had never seen
            it, as a honorarium. After reading it, Abū al- ʿAlā scornfully threw it down, refused to
            incorporate it in his library, and cut off its margins to write prescriptions on them
            for his patients.</p>
          <p>Abū Yaḥyā al-Yassaʿ b. ʿĪsā b. Hazm b. al-Yasaʿ, in his "Astonishing Book of the
            Beauties of the Occidentals," says that Abū al-ʿAlā b. Zuhr became very famous for his
            learning despite his youth. He was forever reading the books of the ancients and
            visiting the masters to seek further knowledge. Chance made his life an easy one and
            fate was always kind to him, until he reached a standard of medicine unknown and
            undreamed of. His professional competance verged on the miraculous and he never made a
            mistake. He devoted himself to other disciplines as well, far surpassing other eminent
            experts. He was admired for his generosity and good nature, although he had a quick
            tongue and was somewhat hasty. But who is perfect and harmoniously developed in every
            way?</p>
          <p>I have copied the following from a manuscript of Muḥammad b. Aḥmad b. Sālih al- ʿAbdī,
            an Occidental with interest in and opinions on medicine: "Abū al-ʿInā the Egyptian, one
            of Abū al-ʿAlā's teachers and the reason for his leaving Baghdād (but this is another
            long story), said: 'I was informed about him by the Shaykh, the physician Abū al-Qāsim
            Hishām b. ʿIsmaʿīl b. Muḥammad b. Aḥmad b. Sāhib al-Salāt, at his house in Seville, may
            God guard it.'"</p>
          <p>One of Abū al-ʿAlā's disciples in medicine was ʿAbū ʿĀmir b. Yannaq, the poet from
            Jativa. Abū al-ʿAlā b. Zuhr died in 557/1161 and was buried in Seville, outside the Gate
            of Victory. [Here follow some specimens of Abū al-ʿAlā's poetry, about love and the
            beauties of India]. <pb n="656" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>When he heard that the Supreme Judge of Seville, b. Mandhur, had asked mockingly: "is
            it possible that Ibn Zuhr is ill?" — he said, "If Ibn Mandhur is surprised at my
            illness, I say: Anyone who walks may stumble. Galen was often ill and an eminent jurist
            may accept bribes."</p>

          <p> i.e., Abū Marwān ʿAbd al-Malik b. Abū al-ʿAlā Zuhr b. Abū Marwān Abd al-Malik b.
            Muḥammad b. Zuhr, attained his father's standing in the medical science <pb n="657"
              ed="kopf"/> as an expert in simple and compound medicines and a perfect practitioner.
            His fame blazed in Andalusia and other countries. Medical men studied his books since
            none of his contemporaries equaled him in the medical theory and practice. There are
            many anecdotes about how he diagnosed and treated maladies in a way never known before.
            He served the Almoravids, who showered favors and money upon him.</p>
          <p>It was in his lifetime that al-Mahdī, i.e., Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad b. ʿAbd Allāh b.
            Tūmart, entered Andalusia with ʿAbd al-Muʿmin and made propaganda and prepared the
            ground for him, until his authority was widely recognized and his kingdom established.
            Al-Mahdī conquered the country and the people obeyed him; but this story of his way to
            power is well known. When ʿAbd al-Muʿmin had become the sole ruler of the kingdom, under
            the title of Emir of the Faithful, and had taken possession of the treasuries of the
            Occident, he spent money lavishly, maintained justice and surrounded himself with
            scholars, whom he treated nobly and munificently. Abū Marwān ʿAbd al-Malik b. Zuhr gave
            his services to him alone and was his sole medical attendant. ʿAbd al-Muʿmin granted him
            more endowments and favors than he could ever have hoped for. Abū Marwān had great
            influence on him, he held a high rank and was more privileged than any of his
            contemporaries. He dedicated to ʿAbd al-Muʿmin his book on theriac, the components of
            which he reduced from seventy to ten and then to seven, the seven-drug composition being
            known as "Theriac antula."</p>
          <p>Abū al-Qāsim al-Maʿājinī of Andalusia told me the following story: The Caliph ʿAbd
            al-Muʿmin once needed a purgative, but he hated taking such drugs. Ibn Zuhr handled him
            adroitly. He watered a vine in his garden using water on which purgative power had been
            conferred by immersing or boiling purgative in it. The vine sucked <pb n="658" ed="kopf"
            /> in the purgative power, and it was communicated to its grapes [sic], Ibn Zuhr then
            ordered the Caliph to go on a diet and brought him a bunch of grapes, which he commanded
            him to eat. The Caliph, who had a high opinion of his physician, did as he was told.
            When he had eaten some grapes in b. Zuhr's presence, the latter said: "That will do, O
            Emir of the Faithful you have eaten ten grapes; this will suffice for ten evacuations."
            The Caliph asked what he meant, and Ibn Zuhr told him. The Caliph then evacuated as many
            times as Ibn Zuhr had said, and thereupon felt better.</p>
          <p>Following this episode, Ibn Zuhr's position with the Caliph became even more
            exalted.</p>
          <p>Shaykh Muhyī al-Dīn Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad b. ʿAlī b. Muḥammad b. al-ʿArabī al-Tāʿī
            al-Hātimī of Murcia told me that Abū Marwān ʿAbd al-Malik b. Zuhr, on his way to the
            palace of the Emir of the Faithful in Seville, near the baths of Abū al-Khair and the
            house of Ibn Mu'mal, would pass by a man with a dangerous tumor and a swollen, yellowish
            body. This man would complain of his condition and ask the physician to attend him. One
            day, when he was complaining in this way, Abū Marwān stopped and examined him. Seeing
            near his head an old jar from which the man drank water, he said to him: "Break this
            jar, for it is the cause of your illness." The man refused, saying, "By Allāh, sir, this
            is my only possession." So Abū Marwān ordered one of his servants to break it, and when
            he did a frog appeared, grown during the time it had spent in the jar. Said the
            physician, "You are cured of your malady. Look at what you were drinking from! " And the
            man was indeed cured.</p>

          <p>The Judge Abū Muḥammad b. Aḥmad b. ʿAbd al-Mālik al-Lahmi al-Bājī told me that a
            trustworthy person had told him the following: There was in Seville a distinguished
            physician known as al-Fār, <pb n="659" ed="kopf"/> author of an excellent book in two
            volumes on simple drugs. Abū Marwān b. Zuhr used to eat large quantities of figs, for
            which he had a weakness, while al-Fār did not touch them at all or at most once a year.
            Al-Fār said to Abū Marwān: You are certain to contract a serious ulcer because of your
            ceaseless consumption of figs [an ulcer is called naghla in Andalusia, dubaila
            elsewhere]. Abū Marwān replied, "Your excessive abstention from figs, followed by sudden
            consumption thereof, will no doubt cause you spasms." Al-Fār indeed died of spasms,
            while Abū Marwān's death was caused by ulcer in his side. What remarkable prognoses!
            When Abū Marwān was afflicted with that malady, he treated himself for it; he composed
            special cataplasms and used medicines, all without much success. His son Abū Bakr would
            explain: "O my father, if only you had exchanged this medicine for that, if only you had
            added a little of this or used that . . . " but Abū Marān would reply: "My son, if God
            desires the deterioration of this body, I am not entitled to use any medicine but the
            one by which His will is done."</p>
          <p>Among Abū Marwān's most outstanding disciples in medicine were Abū al-Ḥusayn b. Asdun,
            known as al-Masdum; Abū Bakr, the son of the jurist Abū al-Ḥasan, the Judge of Seville;
            Abū Muḥammad of Sidonia; and the ascetic jurist Abū ʿUmrān b. Abū ʿUmrān.</p>
          <p>Abū Marwān ʿAbd al-Mālik b. Abū al-Alā b. Zuhr died in and was buried in Seville
            outside the Gate of Victory. His books are:</p>

          <head><persName>Al Hafīd Abū Bakr b. Zuhr</persName></head>
          <p> (grandson of Abū al-ʿAlā). Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. Abū Marwān b. Abū al-ʿAla b. Zuhr was
            physician to the vizier and an outstanding man of letters. He was born and bred in
            Seville, where he distinguished himself in the sciences. He studied medicine under his
            father and subsequently practiced it. He was a man of average height, with a strong
            consitution and sturdy limbs. In old age he retained his healthy complexion and supple
            movements, showing no sign of weakness, except that he became deaf during his last
            years. He knew the Qur'ān by heart, observed the Hadīth and devoted himself to the study
            of Arabic language and literature. None of his contemporaries knew the language better
            than he, and he is said to have attained perfection in the study of both medicine and
            literature. He wrote excellent poetry; his Andalusian songs were considered the best of
            their kind. He was strict in religious belief and practice, of steadfast character,
            good, honest and outspoken. He was the best physician of his time, and his fame spread
            all over Andalusia and beyond.</p>
          <p>The Judge Abū Marwān Muḥammad b. Aḥmad b. ʿAbd al-Mālik al-Bājī of Seville told me that
            according to what he had heard from the Shaykh, vizier and physician Abū Bakr b. Zuhr,
            the latter had <pb n="661" ed="kopf"/> spent seven years in the company of his
            grandfather ʿAbd al-Mālik al-Bājī, studying with him; under his direction he had read
            Sahnūn's "Selection after the Māliki School" and the Musnad of Ibn Abū Shaiba.</p>
          <p>The Judge also told me that Abū Bakr b. Zuhr had been a very strong man, who could lift
            150 Sevillian rotls [The Sevillian rotl is 16 uqiyyas and an uqiyya is 10 dirhams]. Abū
            Bakr played an excellent game of chess, and there was no physician like him in his time.
            He served two dynasties, since he lived in the days of the Almoravids, whom he attended
            with his father until their end, whereupon he served the Almohads, the house of ʿAbd
            al-Muʿmin, in whose reign his father died; he served ʿAbd al-Muʿmin, his son Abū Yaʿqūb
            Yūsuf, the latter's son Abū Yūsuf, surnamed al-Mansūr, and Abū Yūsuf's son Abū ʿAbd
            Allāh Muḥammad al-Nāsir. Abū Bakr b. Zuhr, may God bless him, died at the beginning of
            al-Nāsir's reign, in 596/1199, in Maʿrrākash, which he had come to visit, and was buried
            there in the place known as the Tombs of the Shaykhs. He was nearly sixty years of
            age.</p>
          <p>The Judge adds that Abū Bakr b. Zuhr had great powers of discernment, was an excellent
            practitioner and prescribed detailed regimes. This was well known. One day, his father,
            Abū Marwān b. Zuhr, gave the Caliph ʿAbd al-Muʿmin a purgative. When Abū Bakr, then
            still young, saw this, he said: "This simple drug must be changed for such and such."
            The Caliph did not take the other drug, but Abū Marwān's father, noticing this, said: "O
            Emir of the Faithful, he is right." He then changed the simple drug for the other, which
            was visibly effective. Abū Bakr b. Zuhr wrote the "Theriac of Fifty," dedicated to
            al-Mansūr Abū Yūsuf Yaʿqūb.</p>
          <p>The Judge adds that a reliable person of the Banū al-Yanāqī, a friend of al-Hafīd Abū
            Bakr b. Zuhr, who visited him frequently to <pb n="662" ed="kopf"/> play chess, told the
            following story. One day he was playing chess with al-Hafīd in the latter's house when
            his host, noticing that he was not his usual cheerful self, asked him: "What is
            troubling you. You seem preoccupied with something; let me know it." The other replied,
            "I have betrothed my daughter to a man who is now demanding her, and I need 300 dinars."
            Said al-Hafīd: "Play and do not worry, for right now I have 300 dinars less five, which
            you will get." They played for a while, after which al-Hafīd called for the money and
            gave it to him. Some time later his friend came back and left 300 dinars less five with
            him. Said Ibn Zuhr: "What is this?" and the man replied: "I have sold some of my olives
            for 700 dinars, and here are 295 dinars in repayment of the sum you were kind enough to
            lend me; I now have 400 dinars left." Ibn Zuhr said:'"Take this money back and make a
            profit from it, for I did not give it to you in order to be repaid. The man refused,
            saying, "I am now, thank God, comfortably off, and have no need to borrow this or
            anything from anyone." After some further argument, Ibn Zuhr said: "Are you my friend or
            my enemy?" Said the man, "Of course I am your friend; I love you more than anyone else."
            Said Ibn Zuhr: "Friends share all their property; each takes whatever he needs out of
            the common fund." The man did not accept this view, so Ibn Zuhr concluded: "By Allāh, if
            you do not take this money back, I shall be your enemy and never speak to you again."
            The man thereupon took the money back, full of gratitude.</p>
          <p>The Judge Abū Marwān al-Bājī reports that the Caliph al-Mansūr decided not to leave a
            single book on logic or philosophy in his kingdom and burnt many; he further insisted
            that nobody should study or possess any such book on pain of severe retribution. <pb
              n="663" ed="kopf"/> When the Caliph launched his scheme, he placed al-Hafīd Abū Bakr
            b. Zuhr in charge of it, but allowed him to keep whatever books on those subjects he
            himself had, on condition that he did not study them or show them to others. While Ibn
            Zuhr was carrying out his assignment, collecting books from scholars and others and
            destroying them, and punishing people who contravened the ban there was in Seville an
            important person who hated and envied him, and who was of spiteful disposition. That
            person wrote a complaint against Ibn Zuhr, saying that he was constantly occupied with
            philosophy and had many of the proscribed books in his house. He collected the
            signatures of many witnesses and sent his report to al-Mansūr, who was staying at Hisn
            al-Farah. This place, two miles from Seville, had such pure air that wheat kept fresh
            there for eighty years— and it was Ibn Zuhr who had advised al-Mansūr to build his
            castle in that place and stay there from time to time. When al-Mansūr had read the
            report, he ordered the man who had written it to be thrown in prison. This was done, and
            all the witnesses who had signed the document fled. Said al-Mansūr, "I have charged Ibn
            Zuhr with this mission, because he is above reproach; by Allāh, even if all the people
            of Andalusia were standing here to give evidence against him in accordance with this
            complaint, I would not be impressed, for I know the soundness of his faith and way of
            thinking."</p>
          <p>Abū al-ʿAbbās Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. Aḥmad of Seville told me the following: "Two
            students came to al-Hafīd Abū Bakr b. Zuhr to study medicine under his guidance. They
            stayed for a time, reading some books on medicine with him. One day, he noticed a small
            book on logic in the hand of one of them: they were coming in the company of Abū
            al-Ḥusayn, known as al-Masdūm, with the intention of studying it. When Ibn Zuhr saw the
            book, he asked: "What is it? " He took it <pb n="664" ed="kopf"/> and looked into it
            and, on finding it to be a book on logic, threw it into a corner and got up barefoot to
            hit them. They fled from him and he followed, running despite his unshod condition,
            cursing them vehemently. They ran on until he turned back, after covering a great
            distance. They kept away from him for many days, not daring to show their face, until
            they regained their confidence and came back. They excused themselves, saying that the
            book was not theirs, that they were not on their way to him, that they had mocked the
            youth interested in it in any way, that they had seen it in the hand of a youth and
            taken the book from him by force, whereupon it had remained with them until they entered
            the house. He pretended to accept their apologies, whereupon they continued to study
            medicine with him. After a while, he told them to learn the Qur'ān by heart, to devote
            themselves to the study of religious law, tradition and exegesis and to be strict in the
            observance of religious precepts. They carried out his order perfecting their knowledge
            of the aforesaid subjects and inuring themselves to the observance of religious
            precepts. One day, when they were at his house, he suddenly took out the book on logic
            which he had confiscated from them, and said: "Now you are qualified to read this book
            and other similar ones with me." Which they did, marveling at his mode of action — may
            God bless him — which proved his great wisdom and strength of character. The Judge Abū
            Marwān al-Bājī told me the next story. Abū Zaid ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Yūjān, the vizier of
            al-Mansur, was an enemy of Ibn Zuhr, jealous of his knowledge and prominent position. He
            conspired to poison him via one of his servants. That man put poison in some eggs he
            gave to al-Hafīd when his niece was with him. His sister and niece were experts in
            medicine, especially skilled in the treatment of women; they regularly visited
            al-Mansur's harem — at <pb n="665" ed="kopf"/> first the mother and after her death the
            daughter — and were the only ones to attend the children of the Caliph and his family.
            After al-Hafīd and his niece had eaten the eggs, they both died, no treatment being of
            any avail. The Judge adds: "Abū Zaid ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Yūjān did not die a natural
            death, but was murdered by one of his relatives.</p>
          <p>One of the most celebrated disciples of al-Hafīd Abū Bakr b. Zuhr in the field of
            medicine was Abū Jaʿfar b. al-Ghazzāl.</p>
          <p>Muhīy al-Dīn ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad b. Muḥammad al-ʿArabī al-Hātimī recited to me the
            following lines of poetry by al-Hafīd, which he had heard from al-Hafīd himself; they
            tell of his longing for his son. [Quotation. ]</p>
          <p>The Judge Abū Marwān b. al-Bājī recited to me the following verses, which Abū ʿImrān b.
            ʿImrān, the ascetic from Mertola who lived in Seville, had heard from al-Hafīd himself
            at the end of his life. [A poem follows.] The Judge recited another verse, which he had
            heard from al-Hafīd himself [another poem].</p>
          <p>The Shaykh Alam al-Dīn Qaisa b. Abū al-Qāsim b. ʿAbd al-Ghani b. Musāfir al-Hanafī the
            geometrician recited to me these verses of al-Hafīd, which are marvelously original in
            style and full of word play. [An example is quoted. ]</p>
          <p>Of the muwashshahāt [Andalusian songs] of al-Hafīd Abū Bakr b. Zuhr, the following were
            recited to me by Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd Allāh, great-grandson of the physician Abū Muḥammad
            ʿAbd Allāh, the son of al-Hafīd. Abū ʿAbd Allāh's father was Abū Marwān Aḥmad, the son
            of the Judge Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad b. Aḥmad b. ʿAbd al-Malik al-Bājī, who had married
            the daughter of Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd Allāh, the son of al-Hafīd. Their son was Abū Marwān
            Aḥmad, who was murdered perfidiously by Ibn al-Ahmar, in 630/1233, at the age of <pb

          <p> Abū Bakr b. Zuhr, i.e., Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Hafīd Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. Abū
            Marwān ʿAbd al-Malik b. Abū al-ʿAlā Zuhr b. Abū Marwān ʿAbd al-Malik b. Muḥammad b.
            Marwān b. Zuhr, was a man of exemplary conduct, generous, intelligent, of sound
            judgment, and with all that good-looking and careful of his attire. He concerned himself
            seriously with the science of medicine and the verification of its teachings. He studied
            under his father, who revealed to him many of the secrets of that science and its
            practical application. He read with his father Abū Hanlfa al-Dīnawarī's "Book of Plants"
            and came to know it perfectly. The Caliph Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad al-Nāsir b. al-Mansūr
            Abū Yaʿqūb respected him greatly, knowing the scope of his knowledge and the nobility of
            his family.</p>
          <p>The Judge Abū Marwān al-Bājī told me as follows: When Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd Allāh b.
            al-Hafīd went to Marrakesh, he spent about ten thousand dinars for travel expenses etc.,
            but when he had met the Caliph al-Nāsir in al-Maldīn, after the latter's conquest of
            that city, he became his medical attendant in the customary way. Abū Muḥammad b.
            al-Hafīd said to the Caliph, "O Emir of the Faithful, I have, thank God, everything now
            as a result of your generosity to me and my forefathers. You gave my father such riches
            that I could not spend them all in a lifetime; but I have come to serve you as did my
            father and to sit in his place close to you, Emir of the Faithful. " Al-Nāsir respected
            him highly and gave him more gifts than are imaginable and whenever he was present, he
            sat in his father's place near the Caliph. The preacher and judge Abū Abd Allāh Muḥammad
            b. al-Ḥasan b. Abū al-Ḥasan b. Abū <pb n="667" ed="kopf"/> Yūsuf Hajjāj sat by the
            Caliph's side; then came the noble Judge Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Ḥusaynī and then Abū Muḥammad
            ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Hafīd Abū Bakr b. Zuhr. At his side sat Abū Mūsā ʿĪsā b. ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz
            al-Jazālī, author of the famous Introduction to Grammar," known as "al-Jazūlīya." Abū
            Muḥammad ʿAbd Allāh b. al Hafīd studied grammar under him.</p>
          <p>Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Hafīd Abū Bakr was born in Seville in 577/1181 and died —
            may God have mercy upon him — by poison in 602/ 1205 in Sale, in the suburb known as
            Ribat al-Fath, and was buried there. He had been on his way to Marrakesh, but death took
            him en route. His remains were transferred from Sale to Seville and reinterred there
            close to the tombs of his ancestors outside the Gate of Victory. He died at the age of
            25. </p>
          <p>One of the most astonishing stories the Judge Abū Marwān al-Bājī told me concerning Abū
            Muḥammad b. al-Hafīd is the following: "One day I was in his house, and he said to me —
            'Yesterday I saw my sister in a dream' (his sister was dead) 'and I heard myself
            exclaiming, 'By Allāh, O my sister, tell me how long I shall live.' She said: 'Two
            tabiyas and a half' [a tabiya — so called in Maghrib — is a plank used in construction;
            its length is ten spans]. Said I, 'I am talking to you seriously and you are mocking
            me!' Said she — 'By God I am not. What I have told you is serious, but you do not
            understand it. Is not the tabiya ten spans, and two tabiyas and a half twenty-five
            spans? You will live twenty-five years.'" The Judge Abū Marwān continued; "When he
            related this vision, I said — 'Do not worry, perhaps it was just a confused dream'";
            then he added: "He died before the year was out at the age that had been foretold —
            twenty-five years, no more, no less." <pb n="668" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>He left two sons, each an eminent personality and a member of a noble profession; the
            elder was called Abū Marwān ʿAbd al-Malik and the younger Abū al-ʿAlā Muḥammad. The
            latter studied medicine and had a profound knowledge of Galen's books. Both brothers
            lived in Seville.</p>

          <head><persName>Abū Jaʿfar b. Hārūn al-Tarjālī</persName></head>
          <p> was one of the leading personalities in Seville, adept in the philosophical sciences,
            who studied Aristotle and other ancients. He was an upstanding physician, expert in the
            general and specialized aspects of the medical art, and an excellent practitioner with a
            remarkable technique. He served Abū Yaʿqūb, the father of al-Mansūr. He was a disciple
            of the jurist Abū Bakr b. al-ʿArabī and studied the Hadīth for a time under his
            guidance. Abū Jaʿfar b. Hārūn himself became a master of the Hadīth and the teacher of
            Abū al-Walid b. Rushd in medicine and the different sciences. He was born in Trujillo, a
            frontier town of Andalusia, which al-Mansūr found deserted by its fleeing inhabitants
            and which was thereupon repopulated by Muslims. Abū Jaʿfar was also an expert
            ophthalmologist and left excellent writings on therapeutics.</p>
          <p>The Judge Abū Marwān Muḥammad b. Aḥmad b. ʿAbd al-Malik al-Lakhmī Bājī told me that his
            brother, the Judge Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad b. Aḥmad, as a boy was injured in the eye
            with a stick, and that the iris was so badly damaged that there was no hope for
            recovery. His father called Abū Jaʿfar b. Hārūn and showed him his son's eye, saying; "I
            will pay you 300 dinars if you help him." Said the doctor, "By Allāh, I have no need of
            the money, but I will treat him so that he will recover, if God wills it." He treated
            the boy until he regained his eyesight. Ibn Hārūn was afflicted with a numbness and
            weakness of the limbs, so he remained in his house in Seville and treated his patients
            there. He died in Seville. <pb n="669" ed="kopf"/>

          <head><persName>Abū al-Walīd b. Rusha.</persName></head>
          <p> The Judge Abū al-Walīd Muḥammad b. Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. Rushd was born and brought up
            in Cordoba. He was an outstanding personality, devoted to the sciences, and a unique
            scholar in the field of religious law and exegetics. He studied under the learned jurist
            Aba Muḥammad b. Rizq. He was also adept in medical science, an excellent writer and a
            remarkable thinker He wrote the "Book of General Principles" [of medicine], which is
            very well written. He was a friend of Abū Marwān b. Zuhr, and when he compiled the
            aforementioned book, he asked his friend to write the "Book of Details" so that the two
            books might embrace the whole of the medical art. This is why, at the end of his book,
            Ibn Rusha says: "This book, concerned with the treatment of diseases in general, is
            written in the most precise and lucid manner we have been able to contrive. It now
            remains for us to write about the cure of the afflictions of the various parts of the
            body, though it is not absolutely necessary for us to do so because the subject matter
            is implicitly contained in the aforementioned 'General Principles,' and its presentation
            is thus in fact a repetition. We shall discuss the treatment of diseases member by
            member, in the manner commonly adopted by the authors of books on therapeutics, so as to
            add detailed information to the general conclusions. This is the best procedure, for it
            results in a maximum of detail. However, we shall defer this task until such time we
            shall have more leisure for it, as at present we are preoccupied with other important
            matters. Anyone who, having read this book without the other part would like to continue
            his study of therapeutics, had best turn to Abū Marwān b. Zuhr's book called al-Taisīr,'
            which was written in our time and at our request and which we ourselves copied so that
            it might be published. This is the aforementioned 'Book of Details,' closely linked with
            my "Book of General <pb n="670" ed="kopf"/> principles.' However, Ibn Zuhr, in the
            fashion of the authors of books on therapeutics, discusses the symptoms and causes of
            diseases along with their treatment. Whoever has read our book need not trouble with the
            former; it will be sufficient for him to study the treatment. To sum up, whoever has
            taken advantage of our 'Book of General Principles' is able to distinguish between what
            is right and what is wrong in the treatments described by the authors of books on
            therapeutics and in their explanations of the way to apply them."</p>
          <p>The Judge Abū Marwān al-Bājī says that the Judge Abū al-Walīd b. Rushd was of superior
            intelligence and sound judgment, modest in his outward appearance and possessing great
            strength of character. For a time he studied medicine and the different sciences under
            Abū Jaʿfar b. Hārūn; he learnt from him a great deal about philosophy.</p>
          <p>Ibn Rushd was a judge in Seville before he settled in Cordoba. He held a high position
            at al-Mansūr's court and was highly influential during his reign. Al-Mansūr's son,
            al-Nāsir, also esteemed him greatly. When al-Mansūr was in Cordoba on his way to attack
            Alfonso, in the year 591/1194, he sent for Ibn Rushd. When Ibn Rushd appeared before
            him, the Caliph did him the supreme honor of assigning him the place usually occupied by
            Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Wāhid, the son of the Shaykh Abū Hafs al-Hintātī, the companion of
            ʿAbd al-Muʿmin, who was the third or fourth of the Ten [followers of Ibn Tumart].</p>
          <p>Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Wāhid was al-Mansūr's son-in-law and was held in great esteem by
            him. The Caliph's daughter bore him a son called ʿAlī, who is now the ruler of Africa.
            When al-Mansūr had Ibn Rushd sitting by his side, he conversed with him. Then Ibn Rushd
            went out, finding some of his disciples and many of his friends waiting to congratulate
            him on the reception accorded him by al-Mansūr. Said <pb n="671" ed="kopf"/> Ibn Rushd:
            "By Allāh, this is not a matter for congratulation, for the Emir of the Faithful favored
            me at once much more than I had hoped for or wished for." There was a group of b. Rushd
            who had spread a rumor that the Emir of the Faithful had ordered his death. When he came
            out safe and sound, he told one of his servants to go to his family and ask them to
            prepare a broth of kittens and young pigeons for when he should arrive; he wanted them
            to feel happy about his deliverance. But later al-Mansūr punished Ibn Rushd and ordered
            him to go and remain in Lucena, a town close to Cordoba and inhabited mainly by Jews. He
            also punished some other distinguished personalities, ordering them to stay in different
            places. He said that the reason for this punishment was what he called their devotion to
            philosophy and the science of the ancients. The members of the group were. Abū al-Walīd
            b. Rushd, Abū Jaʿfar al-Dhahbī, the jurist Abū Allāh Muḥammad b. Ibrāhīm (the Judge of
            Biggaya), Abū al Rabī ʿal-Kafīf and Abū al-ʿAbbās (the learned poet al-Qurābī). They
            remained in disgrace for some time. A group of notables in Seville then gave witness in
            favor of Ibn Rushd, saying he was being punished unjustly, and al-Mansūr pardoned him
            and the rest of the group in 595/1198. The Caliph made Abū Jaʿfar al-Dhahabī head of the
            students and physicians and said he was like pure gold, the excellence of which is
            increased by fashioning.</p>
          <p>The Judge Abū Marwān said: "What impressed al-Mansūr about Ibn Rushd was that whenever
            he came to al-Mansūr's court to discuss or examine some scholarly matters with him he
            would address the Caliph with the words — 'Listen, O my brother'; on the other hand, in
            his 'Book of Animals,' in which he mentions their habitats and describes each animal, he
            speaks of the giraffe, saying: 'I have seen the giraffe with the barbarian king,' by
            which he means al-Mansūr. When al-Mansūr heard this, he took it hard, and it was one of
            the reasons that he exiled Ibn Rushd. It is said that one reason that he <pb n="672"
              ed="kopf"/> pardoned him was Ibn Rushd's explanation: I said "the king of the two
            continents" (malik al-barran), but the copyist wrote "the king of the Barbars" (malik
            al-barbar).</p>
          <p>The Judge Abū al-Walīd b. Rushd, may God have mercy upon him, died at a ripe old age.in
            Marrakesh at the beginning of the year 595/ 1198, early in al-Nāsir's reign. He left a
            son, Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd Allāh who was an expert physician, and other sons who specialized
            in religious law and served as judges in different districts.</p>

          <p>The Judge Abū Marwān al-Tsājī told me the following story: "We were in Tunis,

            collected the required ingredients, except wine, the basic one — wine — which he was

            wine was forthcoming. Said al-Mansūr, "By Allāh, my order to prepare the theriac was

            that I may be known for it and be rid of the nickname 'chess-player'. I realized that
            even if I devoted all my life to law or the literary sciences, I would never become

            its side. When they came close, we perceived a reptile, its head in the man's throat,
            the remainder tied to his arm with a hempen string. Al-A'samm asked: 'What is the matter
            with this man?' They answered: 'He is in the habit of sleeping with his mouth open. One
            night, after drinking milk, he went to sleep, and this reptile came, licked his mouth
            and entered his throat. The man slept on, but when we came in, the reptile got
            frightened and glided further down his throat. We seized it and tied it with this
            string, lest it go right down his throat.' Ibn al-A'samm, on examining the man, found
            him half-dead with fright and said to him: 'Do not worry.' But to the people he said,
            'You almost killed him.' He cut the string, and the reptile slid through the man's
            throat and settled in his stomach. Then he said, 'Now you will recover.' He ordered him
            not to move, took some drugs and aromatics and boiled them well in water, poured the
            water into a jug and made the man drink it hot. When he had drunk it, Ibn al-A'samm felt
            his stomach and eventually pronounced the reptile to be dead. He then made him drink
            different water, in which he had boiled other drugs, and said: 'This will dissolve the
            reptile by the action of digestion in the stomach.' He waited two hours, then made him
            drink still other water, in which he had boiled emetics. The man shivered and began to
            vomit. Ibn al-A'samm bound his eyes, and the man continued to vomit into a brass basin,
            until we found the reptile, reduced to pieces. Ibn al-A'samm ordered the man to vomit
            well, until his stomach would be cleared of all remains of the reptile. He then said to
            him, 'Be happy, because you are cured.' The man walked away safe and sound, after having
            been at death's door." <pb n="683" ed="kopf"/>

          <p> was a physician renowned in Egypt, a Christian well-versed in the teachings of
            Melekite Christianity. Ibn al-Bitrīq says in his book "Nazm al-Jauhar": "In the fourth
            year of the reign of al-Mansūr, the Abbasid caliph, Balītīyan, a physician, was made
            Patriarch of Alexandria. He lived forty-six years. In the days of Harūn al-Rashīd, when
            ʿUbayd Allāh b. al-Mahdī was Governor of Egypt, the latter presented al-Rashīd with a
            slave-girl from Northern Egypt. She was beautiful, and al-Rashīd loved her very much.
            One day, she became seriously ill, and the attending physicians were unable to help her.
            So al-Rashīd was told: 'Order ʿUbayd Allāh, your governor in Egypt, to send one of the
            Egyptian physicians,' for they are better able to treat this girl than the Iraqi
            physicians. Al-Rashīd sent a message to ʿUbayd Allāh b. al-Mahdī, ordering him to choose
            one of the most skillful Egyptian physicians, so that he might cure the girl. ʿUbayd
            Allāh called Balītīyān, the Patriarch of Alexandria, a medical expert, and told him
            about al-R ashīd's love for the girl and about her illness. Then he sent him to
            al-Rashīd. Balītīyān took with him some coarse Egyptian cake and little salted fish, and
            when he arrived in Baghdād and met the girl, he had her eat that cake and fish,
            whereupon she recovered. From that time on, these two foods were regularly brought from

          <p> was a physician in Egypt in the days of Aḥmad b. Tulūn, who was attended by him when
            staying in Egypt. On his travels, Aḥmad was attended by Saʿīd b. Taufīl. In the year
            269/882 when Ibn Tūlūn, after proceeding to Damascus and thence to the frontier posts to
            restore peace, was passing through Antioch on his way back, he partook too heartily of
            buffalo milk, so that he contracted Asiatic cholera. Saʿīd b. Tufīl's endeavors to cure
            him were of no avail, and Ibn Tūlun returned to Egypt carrying his ailment with him and
            angry with Saʿīd b. Tufīl. On entering Fustat, he called al-Ḥasan b. Zairak and
            complained to him about Saʿīd. Ibn Zairak belittled the Emir's ailment and told him that
            he was hopeful of his speedy recovery. The disease was to be overcome by rest, quiet,
            peace of mind, sensible behavior and the devoted care of al-Ḥasan b. Zairak. But Aḥmad
            b. Tūlūn secretly consorted with women, as a result of which his ailment grew worse. He
            thereupon called the physicians and threatened them, but he concealed from them the fact
            that he had neglected his regimen by having sexual intercourse. He even asked one of his
            concubines to serve him a certain fish, for which he had a craving. She brought it to
            him secretly, and it had hardly <pb n="685" ed="kopf"/> reached his stomach when he was
            attacked by incessant diarrhea. He called al-Ḥasan b. Zairak and said to him: "I think
            that the medicine you gave me today was not the proper one." Ibn Zairak replied: "The
            Emir, may Allāh lend him support, should order all the physicians of Fustat to assemble
            at his residence each morning and decide unanimously what the Emir should take. I have
            administered nothing to you but medicines which were prepared by a person you trust and
            which are designed to strengthen the retentive powers of your stomach as well as your
            liver." Said Aḥmad: "By Allāh, if you do not succeed in your treatment, I am determined
            to have your head cut off. You are merely experimenting on the sick, but can do no real
            good." Al-Ḥasan b. Zairak left the Emir's presence trembling. He was a very old man. His
            liver became inflamed as a result of anxiety and fear and because, owing to his troubled
            state, he neither ate nor slept. A profuse diarrhea set in, he was overcome with
            chagrin, and eventually his mind became disturbed and he talked deliriously about Aḥmad
            b. Tulūn's ailment. He died the next day.</p>

          <head><persName>Saʿīd b. Tufīl.</persName></head>
          <p> Saʿīd b. Taufīl, a Christian, was in the service of Aḥmad b. Tūlūn and became one of
            his physicians in ordinary. He accompanied the Emir on his travels and attended him when
            he was at home. Before Saʿīd's death, an estrangement occurred between the two which
            came about as follows: Aḥmad b. Tūlūn, as mentioned before, had gone to Syria and
            visited the border region to settle its disturbed affairs. On his return to Antioch, he
            was stricken with Asiatic cholera caused by buffalo- milk of which he had drunk too
            hastily and too much. He sent for his physician, Saʿīd, but was informed that he had
            gone to church. He fell into a rage, and when Saʿīd appeared he reproached him harshly
            for his lateness but disdained to tell him about his condition. The next night, he took
            a turn for the worse. He again sent for the physician, who came in a state of
            drunkenness. Aḥmad said: "I have been ill <pb n="686" ed="kopf"/> these two days, and
            you are drinking wine!" Saʿīd replied: "My master, you sent for me yesterday, when I was
            in church, as is my custom, and when I appeared, you told me nothing.'' Said Aḥmad:
            "Would it not have been proper to ask about my condition?" Saʿīd replied: "My master,
            you are distrustful. I would never ask anyone of your entourage about anything relating
            to you, let alone yourself." Said Aḥmad: "What should I do now?" Saʿīd replied: "Take no
            food, even though you desire it very much, tonight and tomorrow." Said Aḥmad: "But, by
            Allāh, I am hungry, I shall not be able to bear it." Saʿīd reported: "This is an
            imaginary hunger caused by a coldness of the stomach."</p>
          <p>At midnight Aḥmad called for something to eat. He was served seasoned chicks and
            unseasoned balls of chicken and kid's meat, and after he had partaken of them, his
            diarrhea ceased. His servant Nasīm left the room and, meeting Saʿīd who was in the
            house, said to him: "The Emir has eaten such-and-such and as a result his evacuation has
            subsided." Said Saʿīd: "Allāh is the one to be called on for help. The Emir's expulsive
            power has weakened, since the food overcame it; but it will become abominably active
            again." And, by Allāh, the day was hardly dawning when Aḥmad had evacuated more than ten
            times.</p>
          <p>By the time he left Antioch, his ailment had grown steadily worse, but he was strong
            enough to bear it. As he approached Egypt, he found riding difficult, and so a carriage
            was manufactured for him, which was drawn by men and in which he was comfortable. But
            before reaching al-Faramā, he complained about its jolting, and therefore he continued
            his journey to Fustat by boat. A tent was pitched for him on deck, in which he took up
            quarters.</p>
          <p>When b. Tūlūn was in Old Cairo again he began to evince a dislike for Saʿīd the
            physician. He complained about him to Isḥāq b. Ibrāhīm his secretary and friend, and the
            latter said reproachfully to Saʿīd: "Woe unto you! You are skilled in your art and,
            unless you pride yourself on it unduly, you will not scorn to serve the Emir with <pb
              n="687" ed="kopf"/> it. Although the Emir speaks pure Arabic, he has an alien nature.
            He does not understand the demands of medicine, so as to apply them to himself and
            submit to your guidance. Your abundant sagacity has already estranged him from you; be,
            then, friendly and kind to him, devote yourself to his service and keep an eye on his
            condition." Said Saʿīd: "By Allāh, my service to him would be that of a mouse to a cat
            or of a lamb to a wolf. I would rather be killed than associate with him." Aḥmad b.
            Tūlūn died of that illness.</p>
          <p>Nasīm, the servant of Aḥmad b. Tūlūn says: "Saʿīd b. Taufīl, the physician, was in the
            service of the Emir Aḥmad b. Tūlūn. One day, when Aḥmad called for him, he was informed
            that Saʿīd had gone to inspect a farm which he intended to buy. Aḥmad did not react
            until Saʿīd showed up, and then said to him: "O Saʿīd, think of your connection with me
            rather than of the estate you wish to buy and exploit; do not neglect it and take
            warning that you will precede me in death if I am to die in my bed; I shall not let you
            enjoy life after my death."</p>
          <p>Nāsim says: "Saʿīd b. Tufīl despaired of his life because Aḥmad b. Tūlūn refused to
            take his advice. Whenever Aḥmad called him into his presence, there was with him someone
            whose opinion was preferred. Aḥmad believed that Saʿīd had been negligent right from the
            start, and especially when the ailment first attacked him, so that he could not get rid
            of it."</p>
          <p>In the "History of Physicians" I have read the following: "When Saʿīd b. Tufīl first
            associated with Aḥmad, he had a hireling of ugly appearance, called Hāshim, who,
            together with his father, worked with flax. He tended Saʿīd's mule and kept watch on it
            when Saʿīd entered the house of Aḥmad b. Tūlūn. Saʿīd occasionally had him pound drugs
            at his house when he took him home with him, and blow upon the fire over the
            concoctions. Saʿīd b. Tufīl had a son of handsome appearance, endowed with intelligence
            and a sound <pb n="688" ed="kopf"/> knowledge of medicine. At the beginning of their
            acquaintanceship, Aḥmad b. Tūlūn instructed Saʿīd to find a physician for his womenfolk,
            who would reside at the court during Saʿīd's absence. Said Saʿīd: 'I have a son whom I
            have taught and made proficient.' Said Aḥmad: 'Present him to me.' When he was
            introduced, Aḥmad, seeing a handsome youth, possessed of all good qualities, commented
            to Saʿīd: 'He is not suitable to serve the women; for them I need a person of great
            knowledge, but ugly appearance.' Saʿīd was reluctant to have a stranger attend the
            women, for fear that he might disagree and clash with him. He therefore took Hāshim,
            provided him with a dira'a [a loose outer garment] and slippers and appointed him to the
            women.''</p>
          <p>The physician ʿJuraih b. al-Tabbākh relates the following: "I met Saʿīd b. Tufīl
            accompanied by ʿUmar b. Sahir. ʿUmar asked Saʿīd: 'In what position did you install
            Hāshim?' Saʿīd replied: 'In the service of the women, for the Emir wanted a person of
            unprepossessing appearance.' Said ʿUmar: 'An ugly person with a sound education, fitting
            the post, could surely have been found among the sons of physicians. You have disgraced
            the profession, and, by Allāh, once he is well established, he will surely revert to his
            low-class habits.' Saʿīd laughed heartily at these words."</p>
          <p>Hāshim acquired such high prestige among the women that they preferred him even to
            Saʿīd, for he prepared medicines which had a beneficial effect on them as regards
            fatness, pregnancy, the complexion and the growth of hair. When Aḥmad b. Tūlūn's ailment
            became very severe and the physicians assembled in his presence every morning, Mi'at
            ʿAlī, the mother of Abū'l-Ashā'ir, said: "A large crowd of physicians has assembled, but
            Hāshim is not among them. By Allāh, O my Lord, none of them is his equal." Aḥmad said to
            her: "Have him come to me secretly, so that I may talk to him." She secretly brought him
            to Aḥmad after encouraging him to speak. When he appeared before Aḥmad, he looked him in
            the face <pb n="689" ed="kopf"/> and said: "The Emir has not been taken care of, which
            is why he is now in such a condition. May Allāh punish him who took it upon himself to
            treat him."</p>
          <p>Said Aḥmad: "What can be done, then, O blessed one?" And the reply came: "Take a small
            dose of such and such ingredients — and he enumerated nearly one hundred drugs; such
            medicines have a constipating effect at the time they are taken but later have injurious
            consequences in that they weaken the natural forces."</p>
          <p>Aḥmad took that medicine and abandoned that prepared by Saʿīd and the other physicians.
            Since it had a restraining effect, Aḥmad was well satisfied and believed that he had
            been restored to health. He then said to Hashim: "Saʿīd has warned me against eating
            even one mouthful of ʿasīda [a thick paste made of flour and clarified butter], but I
            crave for it." Said Hāshim: "My lord, Saʿīd was mistaken; it is nutritious and will do
            you good." So Aḥmad gave orders for it to be prepared, and it was served to him in a
            large bowl. He ate most of it, felt very happy at having satisfied his desire and lay
            down to sleep. The ʿasīda stuck to his intestine, and he fancied that his condition was
            improving.</p>
          <p>All this happened without Saʿīd b. Tufīl's knowledge. When Saʿīd appeared, Aḥmad asked
            him: "What do you think of ʿasīda?" Saʿīd replied: "It weighs heavily upon the organs,
            while the organs of the Emir need something that will facilitate their action." Said
            Aḥmad: "Stop talking nonsense! I ate it and, thank God, it has proved beneficial to me."
            Then fruit from Syria was brought and Aḥmad asked Saʿīd's opinion about quinces. Saʿīd
            replied: "Suck them out on an empty stomach and an empty intestine; then they will be of
            benefit." When Saʿīd had left, Aḥmad ate some quinces. They met with the ʿasīda and
            expelled it, so that the diarrhea set in again. Aḥmad sent for Saʿīd and said: "You son
            of. . . ! You told me that quinces were good for me, and now my bowels have become loose
            again." Saʿīd went away in order to examine the excrement and on returning said: "The
            ʿasīda, which you praised and which you said I was mistaken in prohibiting, <pb n="690"
              ed="kopf"/> remained in the bowels, which owing to their weakness were unable to
            transform or digest it until the quinces pushed it out. I did not allow you to eat the
            quinces, but advised you to suck them out." He then asked Aḥmad how many he had eaten,
            and Aḥmad said: "Two." Said Saʿīd: "You ate quinces to satisfy your hunger, not for
            medical reasons." Said Aḥmad: "You son of a ... ! You have made sport of me while you
            are in perfect health and I am seriously ill." He then called for whips, dealt him two
            hundred strokes and had him led round on a camel with a herald calling out: "This is the
            punishment of him who was trusted and became a traitor." Saintly men plundered his
            house. He died two days later in Old Cairo. This was in the year 269/832, or, according
            to another report, in the year 279/892, the year in which, in the month of Dhū
            'l-Qaʿdah, Ibn Tulun died; and Allāh knows best."</p>

            al-Tamīmī first lived in Jerusalem and its. vicinity. He was a mine of information on
            plants and their qualities. Moreover, he distinguished himself in practical medicine,
            being familiar with the intricacies of this art. He was very experienced in the
            preparation of electuaries and the application of simple drugs. He had a comprehensive
            knowledge of the different kinds of great theriac — called al-farūq — <pb n="694"
              ed="kopf"/> and their preparation, and he manufactured great quantities of them most
            competently. He later moved to Egypt, where he remained until his death.</p>
          <p>In Jerusalem, he met a savant of great merit, a monk called Anbā Zakharyā b. Tawāba,
            who was conversant with specific aspects of the philosophical sciences and medicine. He
            lived in Jerusalem in the fourth century A. H. and studied the composition of drugs.
            Muḥammad al-Tamīmī visited him regularly and received useful instruction and numerous
            formulas. He mentions him in his book "Māddat al-Baqā," under the entry "A medicinal
            powder for the convulsion caused by inflamed black bile." He says that he is
            transmitting this information in the name of Anba Zakaryā.</p>
          <p>My colleague Jamāl al-Dīn b. al-Qiftī al-Qādī al-Akram says in his book "Ihbār
            al-ʿUlamāʿ bi-Ahbār al-Hukamā": "Saʿīd, the grandfather of Muḥammad b. Aḥmad b. Saʿīd
            al-Tamīmī, was a physician friendly with Aḥmad b. Abī Yaʿqūb, a freed slave of the
            Abbasid family. Muḥammad originated from Jerusalem. There and in other cities to which
            he traveled, he studied medicine and became very proficient in this science, for what he
            acquired of it he mastered most thoroughly. He eagerly studied the composition of drugs,
            and became very adept in preparing them. He delved deeply into this subject and
            dedicated himself to solving its mysteries. It was he who perfected the great theriac by
            adding certain simple drugs; this is a fact upon which all physicians are agreed. On the
            theriac he wrote a number of books, from small essays to large treatises. He was a
            favorite of al-Ḥasan b. ʿAbd Allāh b. Tujj, who had made himself master of al-Ramla and
            the neighboring coastal region. Al-Ḥasan liked both him and the simple and compound
            drugs with which he treated him. Al-Tamīmī prepared for him several electuaries
            medicinal perfumes and fumes against the plague, which he recorded in his writings." <pb
              n="695" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>

          <p>Al-Tamīmī lived to see the rise of the ʿAlid dynasty in Egypt. He became friendly with
            Yaʿqūb b. Killis, the vizier of al-Muʿizz and al-ʿAzīz, for whom he wrote a work of
            several volumes, entitled "Māddat al-Baqa, on the improvement of polluted air and
            precautions against infectious diseases. This was in Cairo during the reign of
            al-Muʿizz.</p>
          <p>In Egypt, al-Tamīmī met some physicians with whom he entered into debates, he also
            associated with the court physicians — those who had come from the Maghrib, in the
            retinue of al-Muʿizz, as well as those who were natives of Egypt.</p>
          <p>Muḥammad al-Tamīmī related the following episode concerning his father: "My father —
            may Allāh be pleased with him — told me that he once became senselessly drunk. Finding
            himself in a tavern in this state, he fell from an elevated place to the ground. The
            proprietor of the tavern picked him up, took care of him and put him up in his own
            living quarters. Next morning, when my father got up, he felt pain and a weakness in
            several parts of his body, but was unaware of the cause. He rode home and worked until
            noon, after which he returned to the tavern and said to the proprietor: I feel pains in
            my body and an extreme weakness, neither of which I can explain.' Said the proprietor of
            the tavern: 'You should thank Allāh that you are still alive.' 'Why?' said my father.
            'Don't you know what happened to you yesterday?' said the other. When my father replied
            that he did not, the man said: 'You were drunk and fell from a high place in the
            tavern.' My father wanted to know from what place he had fallen, and when he was shown
            it, he was so overcome by pain and emotion that he was unable to control himself. He
            began to shout and moan until a physician was called in who performed a bloodletting and
            bandaged his flabby joints. It took a long time until my father recovered and the pains
            left him."  <pb n="696" ed="kopf"/></p>
          <p>I say: A similar story is the following: A merchant, on one of his business trips,
            found himself in the desert, with his caravan. He lay down to sleep in a house at which
            he had stopped on the way, while his companions were sitting round him. Suddenly a snake
            emerged from somewhere, came near his leg, bit it and slipped away. He woke up from the
            pain, clutched his leg and whimpered. One of his company said to him: "Nothing has
            happened but that you suddenly stretched out your leg when it was hurt by a thorn at the
            very spot where you feel the pain." He made as if to take out the thorn and said: "You
            need not worry any more." After that, his pains subsided, and they continued on their
            journey.</p>
          <p>Some time later, having meanwhile been home, they again came to that place, and his
            companion said: "Do you know what really caused the pain that attacked you here?" When
            he replied that he did not, his companion continued: "A snake bit you in the leg; we saw
            it but did not tell you." The man was instantly seized with a violent pain in his leg,
            which spread within his body until it approached the heart. He fainted and his condition
            grew steadily worse, until he died. The reason was that fanciful thoughts and psychic
            processes exercise a strong influence upon the body; when the merchant realized the the
            harm done to him had been caused by a snake bite, his emotions were strongly affected,
            and the remainder of the poison which lingered in that place started to spread through
            his body, killing him when it reached the heart.</p>
          <p>My colleague Jamāl al-Dīn [Ibn al-Qiftī] said: "When al-Tamīmī was in his native city
            of Jerusalem and devoted himself to the study of medicine, trying to master the
            composition of drugs, he wrote about, and actually prepared a theriac which he called
            the preserver of lives. He spoke about it as follows: 'This theriac, which I prepared in
            Jerusalem from the most excellent ingredients, is <pb n="697" ed="kopf"/> concentrated,
            has a beneficial effect and counteracts the damage done by deadly poisons, those which
            are drunk as well as those which are injected into the body by animals such as vipers,
            winged-dragons and other snakes secreting lethal poison, yellow scorpions and others and
            the forty-four-footed animals. This theriac has also proved effective against the sting
            of venomous spiders (phalangia, tarantulas) and large lizards. It has not its
            like.'"</p>
          <p>In his book "Māddat al-Baqā" al-Tamīmī enumerates the ingredients and describes the
            manner of compounding it. While in Cairo, he invented and prepared a kind of sweet which
            he called "key to joy" that is, "free from sorrow" or "that which gladdens the soul"; he
            prepared it for one of his friends in Cairo to whom he indicates the way of compounding
            it and the names of its ingredients. This took place in Cairo, but he calls that city by
            its former name, Fustāt, which was given to it in the days of ʿAmr b. al- ʿAs, when it
            was conquered by the Muslims. All this is mentioned in his book "Māddat al-Baqā."</p>
          <p>Al-Tamīmī was still living in Cairo in the year 370/979. He is the author of the
            following works:</p>
          <list>
            <item n="1"> An epistle to his son, ʿAlī b. Muḥammad, on the manufacture of the thcriac

          <p> The physician Abū 'l-Ḥasan Sahlān b. ʿUtmān b. Qaisān was a native of Egypt and a
            Christian of the Melekite persuasion. He was in the service of the Egyptian caliphs. He
            won prestige during the reign of al-ʿAzīz, and continued to enjoy fame and favor and to
            acquire riches until he died in Cairo, during the reign of al-ʿAzīz bi-Allāh, on
            Saturday, the 25th day of Dhū 'l-Hijja of the year 380/989. On Sunday, after the midday
            prayer his body was taken to the Byzantine Church in the Qasr al-Sham quarter. His
            funeral cortege, which set out from his home and proceeded via Coppersmiths' Quarter,
            the Old Mosque and the Murabbaʿa, eventually reached the al-Gār bathhouse. It was headed
            by fifty men carrying lighted candles. A heavy cloth lay over his coffin. The
            metropolitan 'Ahū 'l-Sayyid and the court physician, Abū 'l-Fath Mansūr b. Muqashshar,
            walked behind his bier, followed by other Christians. From the church his body was
            transferred, after the night had elapsed, to the al-Qusair Monastery, where he was
            buried beside his brother, Qaisān b. ʿUthmān b. Qaisān.</p>
          <p>Al- ʿAziz did not seize his estate, nor did he allow anyone else to appropriate it,

            but their efforts only made things worse. Then the Jew was summoned into al-Hākim's
            presence. After inspecting the patient, he applied a dry medicament, which dried out the
            wound and healed it within three days, whereupon al-Hākim presented him with one
            thousand dinars and a robe of honor, named him al-Haqīr al-Nāfi [the humble one who

          <p>  Abū ʿAlī Muḥammad b. al-Ḥasan b. al-Haitham, a native of Basra, emigrated to Egypt,
            where he stayed for the rest of his life. He was generous, keen-witted and well-versed
            in various sciences. None of his contemporaries equaled or came near him in the
            knowledge of mathematics. He was always busy, wrote a great deal, cultivated ascetic
            habits and was always eager to learn new things. He abridged and annotated a great
            number of Aristotle's works, and abstracted many of Galen's medical writings. He was an
            expert in the theory, its rules and general aspects of medicine, but he did not practice
            it and had no experience in therapy. His works are full of useful information; he
            possessed a beautiful handwriting and considerable mastery of the Arabic language.</p>
          <p>The following was related to me by Shaykh ʿAlam al-Dīn Qaisar b. Abi 'l-Qāsim b. ʿAbd
            al-Gānī b. Musāfir al-Hanafī, the geometrician.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of his career, Ibn al-Haitham was in government service in al-Basrah
            and the surrounding district. But because he aspired to meritorious attainments and to
            the study of philosophy, he strove to free himself from all occupations that prevented
            him from studying. He feigned mental illness and remained in this condition until he
            succeeded in being suspended from service. He then traveled to Egypt and took up
            residence at the al- Azhar Mosque in Cairo. Every year he copied Euclid and the
            "Almagest," sold the copies and lived off the proceeds. He kept up this way of life
            until he died, may Allāh have mercy upon him.</p>
          <p>My colleague, Jamāl al-Dīn Abū 'l-Ḥasan b. al-Qiftī, who also mentions Ibn al-Haitham,
            says about him as follows: When al-Hākim, the Fatimid ruler of Egypt, who himself had a
            strong bent for philosophy, heard about Ibn al-Haitham and his mastery of science, he
            eagerly wished to see him. His enthusiasm increased when he was <pb n="702" ed="kopf"/>
            told that Ibn al-Haitham had said: "If I were in Egypt I would do something to the Nile
            that would make that river useful at all times, both during its rise and during its
            fall, for I have heard that it descends from an elevated place which lies within the
            borders of Egypt." Al-Hākim secretly sent him a great amount of money and prevailed upon
            him to come to him. So he traveled to Egypt, and when he arrived al-Hākim set out to
            receive him. They met in a village known as al-Handak [the ditch], on the outskirts of
            Cairo, the city built by al-Muʿizz. Al-Hākim gave orders to provide him with lodgings
            and to treat him hospitably and with respect. He stayed there until he had rested and
            was then asked to fulfill his promise with regard to the Nile. So he set out with a
            group of skilled building workers. These were to be employed on constructions he had in
            mind. But when he traveled the whole length of the country, and saw the extremely well
            planned and constructed monuments left by its former inhabitants, members of
            long-vanished nations, and the lovely shapes, geometrical forms and unsurpassable
            paintings they contained, he realized that his scheme was unworkable; for those who had
            lived before him in ancient times had not been without the knowledge he himself
            possessed, and if such a scheme had been possible, they would surely have carried it
            out. So his zeal was quenched and his ambition died. When he reached the locality known
            as al-Ganādil, south of the city of Assuan — this is the high place from which the
            waters of the Nile flow down — he was able to overlook the river, come into direct
            contact with it and examine it on both its banks. As a result, he became convinced that
            his plan could not be carried out and that he would have to admit his error in that he
            had promised more than he could fulfill. Disappointed and ashamed, he returned to
            al-Hākim and made apologies to him, which the latter seemed to accept. Al-Hākim then
            appointed him head of one of the <pb n="703" ed="kopf"/> government offices, to which he
            reluctantly agreed, from sheer necessity. He soon realized that he had made a mistake in
            accepting the post, for al-Hākim was extremely capricious, shedding blood for no reason
            at all or on some flimsy, imaginary pretext. So he pondered on means of freeing himself
            and, finding no way out but to feign mental illness, began to act like a lunatic. When
            this became known, his property was confiscated and placed at the disposal of al-Hākim
            and his vicegerents. A guardian was appointed to look after him and his affairs, and he
            himself was chained and confined to a room in his house. This situation continued until
            he learnt that al-Hākim was dead. A short time later, he demonstrated that he was sane,
            returned to his former state, left his house, took lodgings at a qubba [pavilion] at the
            entrance to al-Azhar — one of the great mosques of Cairo — and there led the life of a
            humble ascetic. His belongings, confiscated by al-Hākim, were returned to him, and he
            applied himself to writing, copying and teaching. He had a flawless handwriting, which
            he exploited in copying a great number of mathematical works.</p>
          <p>Yūsuf al-Fasī, the Israelite savant, told me in Aleppo as follows: "I heard that Ibn
            al-Haitham, apart from his other occupations, copied three books every year, namely
            Euclid's 'Elements,' the 'al-Mutawassitāt' and the 'Almagest.' He finished them in the
            course of the year, and whenever he started recopying them, somebody came and gave him
            150 Egyptian dinars for his work. This came to be a fixed price, against which no
            bargaining was of any use. Ibn al-Haitham allotted that sum for his sustenance during
            one year. He continued to do so until he died in Cairo around the year 430/1039; and
            Allāh knows best."</p>
          <p>Say I: I have copied the following from an autographed copy of one of Ibn al-Haitham's
            treatises on ancient sciences, which he finished writing at the end of 417/1027,
            corresponding to the 63rd lunar year of his life. "Since early youth, I have never
            ceased to meditate on the different <pb n="704" ed="kopf"/> beliefs of people and on the
            fact that every group firmly adheres to the opinions once adopted. I was doubtful of all
            of them, holding the view that truth was one and that dissension about it was merely a
            matter of approach. After completing my study of the abstract sciences, I devoted myself
            entirely to the quest for the source of truth, striving to discover something by which
            wrong opinions might be refuted and the aberrations of the fantical sceptic eliminated.
            Thus I resolved to find the concept that brings man close to God, wins His benevolence
            and induces to fear and obey. Him. I found myself in the same position as Galen who, in
            the seventh</p>

          <p>chapter of his 'Means of Attaining Health,' addresses his pupil as follows: 'I do not
            know how it came to pass, whether by marvelous accident, by divine inspiration, through
            madness or from any other cause, but since my youth, I have always despised the vulgar
            crowd and have strived to show respect for truth and acquire knowledge, I am firmly
            convinced that man can attain nothing better in this world, nothing more likely to bring
            him close to God, than those two things.' Therefore I undertook a thorough investigation
            of the various religious creeds, but from none of them did I derive any profit: none
            showed me the road to truth or the straight path which leads to the correct belief. So I
            realized that I would not attain truth except through notions based primarily on sensory
            perceptions and elaborated by rational considerations, and I found that only the method
            established by Aristotle with regard to logic, the natural sciences and metaphysics —
            which are the mainstays and very essence of philosophy."</p>

          <head><persName>Al-Mubashshir bin Fātik,</persName></head>
          <p> i.e., the Emir Maḥmūd al-Dawlah Abū 'l Wafā' al-Mubashshir b. Fātik al-Amirī, was one
            of the most eminent emirs and most distinguished scholars of Egypt. He was always busily
            occupied, loved learning and was fond of meeting scholars, debating with them and
            putting to use what he imbibed from them. One of those with whom he associated and from
            whom he learnt a great deal about astronomy and mathematics was Abū ʿAlī Muḥammad b.
            al-Ḥasan b. al-Haitham. He was also acquainted with Shaykh Abū 'l-Ḥusayn, known as
            al-Āmidī under whom he studied many philosophical disciplines. Moreover, he applied
            himself to medicine, keeping company with the physician Abū 'l-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. Ridwān.</p>

          <p>Al-Mubashshir b. Fātik was the author of excellent works on logic and other
            philosophical disciplines, which have become renowned among specialists. He also engaged
            assiduously in copying books; I have seen numerous volumes in his handwriting,
            containing works by ancient authors. He acquired a huge number of books, many of which
            are still extant, but the color of their leaves has changed owing to immersion in
            water.</p>
          <p>Shaykh Sadīd al-Dīn al-Mantiq told me in Cairo: "The Emir Ibn Fātik was eager to
            acquire knowledge and possessed a collection of books. On coming home, he spent most of
            his time with them, finding no better occupation than reading and writing and convinced
            that this was the most important pursuit. He had a wife of noble descent like him, of
            the family of one of the state dignitaries. After his death — may Allāh have mercy upon
            him — she betook herself with her maids to his library. She bore a grudge against the
            books, since her husband had devoted himself to them and neglected her. While bewailing
            him, she, together with her maids, threw the books <pb n="706" ed="kopf"/> into a large
            water basin in the center of the building. Later the books were retrieved and this is
            why the many books of Ibn Fātik which have been preserved are in such a state."</p>
          <p>I say: Among the pupils of al-Mubashshir b. Fātik was Abū 'l-Hair Salāma b. Rahmūn. </p>
          <p>Ibn Fātik wrote the following books:</p>

          <head><persName>Alī b. Ridwān,</persName></head>
          <p> i.e., Abū 'l-Ḥasan ʿAlī Ridwān b. ʿAlī b. Jaʿfar, was born and bred in Cairo, where he
            studied medicine. In his autobiography, he relates the following details of his studies
            and the circumstances of his life: "Since everyone should choose the profession most
            suitable for him, since medicine is next door to philosophy with regard to obeying God,
            glory and power are His, since my horoscope pointed to medicine as my calling and since
            a livelihood derived from a learned profession seemed more desirable to me than any
            other, I began to study medicine at the age of fifteen. But the best will be for me to
            tell you all about myself.</p>
          <p>"I was born in Egypt, at a place situated 30° latitude and 55° longitude, under the
            sign of Aries according to the astronomical tables of Yaḥyā b. Abī Mansūr. When I was
            six years old, I began to devote myself to study, and when I was ten, I moved to the
            capital and exerted myself to acquire knowledge. In my fifteenth year, I began to study
            medicine and philosophy, but I had no money for my <pb n="707" ed="kopf"/> upkeep, so
            that I experienced great hardship with my studies. At one time, I earned my livelihood
            by astrological fortune-telling, at another by medical work and occasionally by
            teaching. This situation lasted until my thirty-second year. At that time, I became
            known as a physician, and what I then earned by practicing medicine was not only
            sufficient for my support but left me a surplus which I have retained until now, i.e.,
            up to the end of my fifty-ninth year. With my extra income, I bought real estate in this
            city which, if Allāh decrees that she remain safe and if He allows me to attain old age,
            will ensure my subsistence. Since the age of thirty-two I have lived according to a
            plan, which I modified every year until I crystalized it in the shape in which I am
            applying it now, on the threshold of my sixtieth year. It provides, inter alia, that I
            so exert myself in performing my daily professional duties as to make up for the lack of
            health-preserving physical exercise. After resting from these exertions, I partake of
            such food as is calculated to keep me healthy. In performing my work, I always endeavor
            to be modest and kind, to help the troubled, raise the spirits of the worried and assist
            the needy. In doing all this, it is my aim to derive pleasure from work and beautiful
            experiences; in addition, of course, there is some material reward, which I spend in
            part for the well-being of my body and the upkeep of my home, in such a way as amounts
            neither to extravagance nor to stinginess, but always strikes a happy balance, as
            prescribed by common sense. In looking after my household, I repair and replace as is
            necessary; and I store in my house such commodities as food and drink, honey, olive-oil
            and firewood, and also clothing. The money left over after all these expenditures is
            spent on various kinds of charity and useful investments, such as gifts to relatives,
            friends and neighbors and the improvement of my house. The revenue yielded by my real
            estate is assigned to its repair and embellishment and similar investments when the
            occasion arises. <pb n="708" ed="kopf"/> When I am faced with some new project, in
            commerce, building or any other field, and I find that it is very likely to succeed, I
            hasten to carry it out; but if its prospects are meager, I put it aside, awaiting
            further developments and making the necessary preparations.</p>
          <p>"I take care that my dress conforms to that of people of distinction and that it is
            clean and fragrant. I refrain from offensive talk, saying only what is fitting. I avoid
            swearing and base thoughts and eschew self-conceit over-assertiveness. I am inaccessible
            to both covetousness and despair, and if a calamity takes me unaware, I put my trust in
            Allāh the Exalted, and face it, as befits a sound mind, without cowardice or rashness.
            When effecting any commercial transaction, I settle the account in due time, neither
            advancing money nor incurring debt, except when the need arises. When somebody asks me
            for a loan, I give it to him without asking anything in return.</p>
          <p>"The hours of the day left after work I spend in worshiping Allāh, praised be He, I
            take delight in contemplating the kingdom of heaven and earth and glorifying its
            perfection. I meditate on Aristotle's treatise on 'Regimen' and vow to follow its
            instructions morning and evening. In my leisure time I review my doings and experiences
            of the preceding day, and what was good, pleasant or useful I rejoice about and what was
            bad, ugly or harmful I regret and resolve never to repeat.</p>
          <p>"As to the things I take pleasure in, they are the invocation of Allāh, power and glory
            are His, and by contemplating the kingdom of heaven and earth. The ancients and savants
            have written a great number of books on that subject, of which I see fit to refer to the
            following: five books on literature, ten on religious law, the books of Hippocrates and
            Galen on medicine; some books on allied disciplines, such as Dioscorides' 'Book of
            Herbs,' the works of Rufus, Oribasius and Paulus, and al-Rāzī's "al-Hawi"; four books on
            agriculture and <pb n="709" ed="kopf"/> pharmacology. As to the remaining books, I would
            either sell them at any price that is offered or store them in crates, although selling
            them would be preferable."</p>
          <p>I say: This is all he mentions of his life. His birthplace was al-Jīza in Egypt, but he
            grew up in Cairo. His father was a baker. He assiduously applied himself to study, until
            he distinguished himself and became very famous. He entered the service of al-Hākim, who
            appointed him chief physician. His house was situated in the Qasr al-Sham quarter of
            Cairo and it is referred to by his name to the present day, although it was destroyed
            and only a few remnants of it can now be seen. At the time b. Ridwān was in Egypt, there
            occurred a dearth and a severe outbreak of Jallāʿ, which killed off most of the
            population. I copied from the handwriting of al-Muhtār b. al-Ḥasan b. Butlān the
            statement that the dearth in Egypt occurred in the year 445/1054. Ibn Butlān says: "In
            the following year, the level of the Nile fell and, as a result, the dearth became still
            more oppressive. It brought in its train a severe outbreak of plague, which reached its
            peak in the year 447/1056. It is reported that the Sultan supplied shrouds for 80,000
            people at his own expense and that he lost 800 army officers. [On the other hand] much
            money accrued to him from the estates [of those who had died without leaving
            heirs]."</p>
          <p>Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad al-Mālikī, the copyist, told me: "Toward the end of his life,
            Ibn Ridwān became mentally deranged. This happened in the following way. During the
            dearth, he adopted an orphan girl and brought her up in his home. One day, he left her
            alone in the house, where he had valuable objects and about 20,000 gold dinars. She took
            everything and fled, and he never heard of her again, nor ever found out where she had
            gone. From that time on his mind went."</p>
          <p>I say: Ibn Ridwān was strongly inclined to criticize his contemporaries — physicians
            and others — just as he did many of those <pb n="710" ed="kopf"/> preceding him.
            Moreover, he was insolent in his criticism and reviled those with whom he entered into a
            dispute. The most striking instances of such behavior are to be seen in his refutations
            of Hunayn b. Isḥāq, Abū 'l-Faraj b. al-Tayyib and Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. Zakarya
            al-Rāzī.</p>
          <p>Ibn Ridwān had no teacher in medicine to whom his skill might be ascribed. In this
            connection he wrote a book explaining that studying medicine from books was better than
            learning it from teachers. This and similar opinions were refuted by Ibn Butlān in a
            book containing a chapter on the reasons that a student who learns by oral instruction
            is preferable to one who learns from books, provided that each has the same potential.
            Ibn Butlān set forth a number of reasons. [A detailed but obscure list follows.]</p>
          <p>Alī b. Ridwān, may Allāh have mercy upon him, died in Cairo in the year 453/ 1062,
            under the caliphate of al-Mustansir bi-Allāh Abū Tamīm Maʿadd b. al-Zāhir Li-Iʿzaz Dīn
            Allāh b. al-Hākim.</p>

          <p>The following is one of ʿAlī(W)b. Ridwān's sayings: "If a man has an occupation by
            which he exercises his limbs, enjoys the respect of men and earns his livelihood during
            part of the day, the most excellent thing he can do during the rest of his time is to
            worship the Lord; and the best way of worshiping Him is to contemplate the divine
            kingdom and glorify its ruler, praise be to Him. A person granted such a destiny, has
            been given the best of this world and of that which is to come; he is blessed and
            rewarded."</p>
          <p>Here is another of his sayings, which I have copied from his handwriting: "According to
            Hippocrates, a physician should fulfill seven requirements: 1) he should be of perfect
            build, have sound limbs, be intelligent and perceptive, have a well-balanced mind, a
            good memory and excellent natural disposition; 2) he should wear decent clothes, smell
            agreeably and keep his body and apparel clean; 3) he should guard the secrets of his
            patients and not divulge anything <pb n="711" ed="kopf"/> of their complaints; 4) his
            desire to cure the sick should be greater than his desire to obtain a fee and his
            willingness to attend the poor should be greater than his willingness to attend the
            rich; 5) he should be anxious to disseminate knowledge and contribute to human welfare;
            G) he should be modest, sincere and truthful, and should not covet the women and
            property he sees in the homes of his patients, let alone lay hands on them; 7) he should
            be careful of life and property, not prescribe, inadvertently, any deadly medicine and
            abstain from administering drugs which cause abortion; 8) he should treat his foe to the
            best of his ability, exactly as he would treat his friend."</p>
          <p>He further said: "A master in the art of medicine is he who fulfills all those
            requirements after he has become proficient in the art; and a promising student of
            medicine is he who shows signs of a good natural disposition, a pure heart, an unbending
            will to study, intelligence, and a memory capable of retaining what he has learnt."</p>
          <p>Further: "A perfect body is a healthy body, each organ of which is intact, that is to
            say, it performs its particular function, to perfection."</p>
          <p>He continued: "You recognize defects by considering the external appearance of organs,
            the temperature, the temper and the feel of the skin and by checking the functioning of
            the internal and external organs; for instance, you call to a person from a distance,
            and from his reaction draw conclusions as to his sense of hearing; having him look at
            near and distant objects will enlighten you as to his eyesight; his tongue is tested by
            his speech; his strength by his ability to lift heavy objects, his grasp and retention
            of objects, and his gait; another test is, for instance, watching the patient walk
            toward and away from you and ordering him to lie on his back, stretch out his arms and
            raise his legs while pressing them close together; in this way you will diagnose the
            state of his intestine. The condition of his heart can be tested by his pulse and his
            temperament and the <pb n="712" ed="kopf"/> condition of his liver by his urine and the
            state of his humors. You can test his mind by questioning him on various matters and his
            powers of apprehension and reflexes by ordering him to do several things. His desires
            can each be tested according to what stimulates and calms it. In this way should you
            proceed when examining each organ and trait of character.</p>
          <p>"As to defects capable of being perceived through the senses, be not satisfied until
            you have actually perceived them. As to defects ascertainable by inferences, namely
            those recognized by specific symptoms, and as to those that can be established by
            interrogation, probe for them by asking questions until you have covered all of them and
            are able to tell whether there is an actual defect or a potential one or whether the
            patient is in fact in good health.</p>
          <p>Here is one of Ibn Ridwān's maxims: "When summoned to a patient, first give him a
            medicine that is innocuous until you have diagnosed his illness; only then may you treat
            it. Diagnosing an illness means to find out, first, from which humor it has arisen, and
            secondly which organ it affects; having done so, you may proceed with treatment."</p>

          <head><persName>Ifrā'īm b. al-Zaffān,</persName></head>
          <p> i.e., Abū Katīr Ifrāʿim b. al-Ḥasan b. Isḥāq b. Ibrāhīm b. Yaʿqūb, a Jew, was a famous
            Egyptian physician. He was in the service of the caliphs in whose time he lived, and
            received from them much money and many gifts. He studied medicine under Abū 'l-Ḥasan
            ʿAlī b. Ridwān, being one of his most distinguished disciples. In consequence of his
            eagerness to acquire books and have books copied, he eventually built up a large
            collection of medical and other works. He constantly employed copyists, whose upkeep he
            undertook, among them Muḥammad b. Saʿīd b. Hishām al-Hagari, known as Ibn Malsaka. I
            have seen a number of books in the latter's handwriting, which he wrote for Ifrāʿim and
            which were signed by the latter himself.  <pb n="718" ed="kopf"/></p>
          <p>My father told me that a man from Iraq once came to Egypt in order to buy books and
            take them with him. He met Ifrāʿim, who sold him 10,000 volumes from among the books in
            his possession. At that time, al-Afdal, the son of the commander-in-chief of the army,
            was governor [of Cairo). When he heard of the transaction, he wanted those books to
            remain in Egypt and so he sent to Ifrāʿīm from his own treasury the amount of money
            which had been agreed upon, between Ifrāʿīm and the Iraqi as the purchasing price. The
            books were transferred to al-Afdal's library and his honorific names were inscribed in
            them. This is why I have come across a great number of medical and other books bearing
            the name of Ifrāʿīm and also the honorific names of al-Afdal. Ifrāʿīm left more than
            20,000 books and a great deal of money and valuables. </p>
          <p>Ifrāʿīm b. al-Zaffān wrote the following works:</p>
          <list>
            <item n="1"> "Notes and Observations," which he assembled in the form of a compendium. I
              have seen this work in his own handwriting; it contains a complete list of diseases
              and an indication of their treatment.' At the beginning, he writes:"I, Ifrāʿīm, have
              composed this book in order to safeguard those who treat diseases from error."</item>
            <item n="2"> A medical memorandum on the proper condition of the body; he wrote it for

              leave Cairo for Alexandria, al-Buhaira and the surrounding country.</item>
            <item n="3"> A treatise proving by deduction that phlegm is produced in larger

          <p> i.e., Abū 'l-Khair Salāma b. Mubarak b. Raḥman b. Mūsā, an Egyptian physician and a
            prominent personality in his country, was a Jew of whom remarkable achievements in the
            medical art are reported. He was familiar with Galen's works and tried to elucidate
            their obscure passages. He studied <pb n="719" ed="kopf"/> medicine under Ifrāʿīm,
            practiced it for a time under his supervision and also applied himself, with success, to
            logic and the other philosophical sciences, writing some works in this field. His
            teacher of logic was the Emir Abū 'l-Wafāʿ Maḥmūd al-Dawlah al-Mubashshir b. Fātik. When
            Abū 'l-Salt ʿUmayya b. ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz b. Abi al-Salt al-Andalūsī came to Egypt from the
            Maghrib, he became acquainted with Salāma b. Rahmūn, and the two engaged in debates and
            controversies. In his "Egyptian Epistle" Ibn Abī al-Salt mentions Salāma among the
            Egyptian physicians he met and says about him: "The most congenial of those I met and
            the worthiest to be counted among the physicians was a Jew called Abū 'l-Khair Salāma b.
            Raḥman. He was acquainted with Abū 'l-Wafā al-Mubashshir b. Fātik, studied logic under
            him, became an expert in it and surpassed his colleagues. He also associated with Abū
            Katīr b. al-Zaffān, the pupil of Abū 'l-Ḥasan b. Ridwān, and studied some of the works
            of Galen under him. Thereafter he started teaching all the books on logic, natural
            philosophy and astronomy. However, he explained things according to his fancy and
            expounded and summarized without due competence. He talked much and committed errors,
            was quick in answering and made mistakes. When I first met him, I tested his knowledge
            by asking him questions of such a kind as could be understood even by one who was a
            beginner in science. He answered them in a way that betrayed his shortcomings, reflected
            his incompetence and clearly showed his lack of imagination and understanding. With his
            great pretensions and poor comprehension of even the most elementary aspects of what he
            was dealing with, he could be compared to the man described by a poet:</p>
          <quote><p><l>He bares his thighs in order to plunge into the deep sea, </l><l> Yet the
                waves submerge him even on the shore.</l></p></quote>
          <p>Or as another poet puts it:</p>
          <quote><p><l>You made bold to encounter two hundred horsemen. </l><l> But a single one has
                driven you back.  <pb n="720" ed="kopf"/></l></p></quote>
          <p>There was in Cairo a physician from Antioch called Jurjis and nicknamed "the
            philosopher," who was, as is called in the West, Abū-l-Baidā'. Ibn Rahmūn would compose
            medical and philosophical tracts in the language of the common people which were absurd,
            meaningless and of no use at all. He sent them to persons who would thereupon request
            him to elucidate them. He would then explain them as he saw fit, on the spur of the
            moment, without due consideration. These tracts are quite ludicrous.</p>
          <p>The said Jurjis composed about him the following lines, which are the best piece of
            satirical poetry I have ever read about an incompetent physician:</p>
          <quote><p><l>Despite Abū 'l-Khair's ignorance, </l><l> The learned are found light on his
                scales.</l><l> His poor patients, because of his bad luck,</l><l> Perish in a sea
                that has no shore.</l><l> Three enter all at a time:</l><l> Himself, the bier and
                the body-washer.</l></p></quote>
          <p>Another remarked:</p>
          <quote><p><l>Abū 'l-Khair in the treatment of patients, </l><l> Has a hand that never
                fails. </l><l> Everyone seeking his assistance </l><l> Is buried after two
              days.</l></p></quote>
          <p>Here is still another poem:</p>
          <quote><p><l>Abū 'l-Khair's craziness is craziness indeed,</l><l> Any craziness being in
                his eyes the acme of reason.</l><l> Seize him, chain him, tie him up
                securely,</l><l> For he who underrates a lunatic is not of sound mind.</l><l> At
                first, he harmed people by his talk alone,</l><l> But now he has begun to injure by
                both words and deeds.  <pb n="721" ed="kopf"/></l></p></quote>

            service of the Egyptian Caliphs, he enjoyed their favor and attained high rank. He was
            one of the most outstanding masters of the medical art, endowed with remarkable
            foresight as to his treatments. In Egypt he wrote a large number of works on medicine,
            logic and other sciences. He had several disciples, who worked under his supervision and
            each of whom distinguished himself in the medical art. At the beginning of his career,
            he made a living by practicing astrology.</p>
          <p>My father told me: "A grandson of Shaykh Abū Nasr ʿAdnān b. al-ʿAinzarbī informed me
            that his grandfather had gained fame in Egypt and came into contact with the caliphs in
            the following way: An envoy from Baghdad who had been acquainted with Ibn al-ʿAinzarbī
            in that city and knew him as a person of wide learning, came to Egypt. While walking
            along a street in Cairo, he suddenly saw Ibn al-ʿAinzarbī sitting there practicing
            fortune-telling for a living. He recognized him and greeted him, wondering why a man of
            such great learning, a first-rate expert in medicine, should be in such <pb n="722"
              ed="kopf"/> a sorry condition. He kept the incident in mind and, on meeting the
            Vizier, mentioned Ibn al-ʿAinzarbī in the course of the conversation, pointing out his
            great knowledge and experience in medicine, etc. He remarked that the people were
            unaware of his worth and that a person of his caliber should not be disregarded. The
            Vizier eagerly desired to meet b. al-ʿAinzarbī. He sent for him and, on listening to
            him, was much impressed and was convinced of his talents and eminence in science. He
            spoke about him to the Caliph, who awarded him such a stipend as befitted a man like
            him. Presents from court dignitaries now reached him continually."</p>
          <p>I say: Ibn al-ʿAinzarbī was well-versed in the Arabic language and had a beautiful
            handwriting. I have seen a number of books on medicine and other subjects written in his
            hand, which were extremely well produced — on the pattern established by the great
            calligraphers. He also engaged in writing poetry and left some fine verses. He died, may
            Allāh have mercy upon him, in Cairo in the year 54 8/1156, during the reign of al-Zāfir
            bi-Amr Allāh. </p>
          <p>Ibn al-ʿAinzarbī wrote the following works:</p>

          <head><persName>Balmuzaffar b. Muʿarraf,</persName></head>
          <p> i.e., Balmuzaffar Nasr b. Maḥmūd b. al Muʿarraf, was a wise and clever man, who
            applied himself assiduously to the philosophical sciences. He also studied medicine and
            literature and composed poems. He was a disciple of Ibn al-ʿAinzarbī, to whom he
            attached himself for a time, studying under him many of the philosophical and other
            sciences. At the end of a copy of Alexander's commentary on Aristotle's "De Generatione
            et Corruptione," I have seen a note in Ibn al-ʿAinzarbī's handwriting confirming that
            Balmuzaffar read it under him and studied it thoroughly; the copy was dated of Saʿbān of
            the year 534/ 1 130.</p>
          <p>Balmuzaffar had a beautiful handwriting and a fine diction. He was keenly interested in
            alchemy and was eager to meet its adepts. With his own hand he copied a immense number
            of books on that subject, as well as numerous medical and philosophical books. He was
            most ardent to acquire books and study them.</p>
          <p>Shaykh Sadīd al-Dīn al-Mantiqī told me that Balmuzaffar had in his house a large room
            whose shelves were crammed with books. In that room, he spent most of his time, writing,
            reading and copying. A noteworthy detail is that among the many thousands of books he
            possessed there was none that did not contain witticisms and anecdotes, relating to the
            respective branch of knowledge, inscribed on its cover. I have seen a great number of
            medical and philosophical works that formerly belonged to Abū 'l- Muzaffar and had his
            name inscribed on them, each bearing on it some interesting notes and sundry remarks
            pertinent to its contents.</p>
          <p>Here are some samples of Balmuzaffar's poetry: </p>
          <quote><p><l>It is said that nature is the origin of existence. </l><l> Would that I knew
                what nature really is! </l><l> Whether a powerful being that has formed itself as it
                is, </l><l> Or whether incapable of this.  <pb n="724" ed="kopf"/></l></p></quote>
          <p>Another poem:</p>
          <quote><p><l>It is said that nature is what we know —</l><l> This is how we define
                it.</l><l> Now, they who do not know what was before it, </l><l> How can they
                presume to explore what is after it?</l></p></quote>
          <p>Balmuzaffar wrote the following works:</p>

            <item n="1"> "Notes on Alchemy."</item>

          <head><persName>Al-Shaykh al-Sadīd al-Tibb,</persName></head>
          <p> i.e., al-Qādī al-Ajall al-Sadīd Abū al-Mansūr ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Shaykh al-Sadīd Abū
            al-Ḥasan ʿAlī. His honorific name was Sharaf al-Dīn, but his father's honorific name was
            so commonly applied to him that he was known by it and al-Shaykh al-Sadīd became, as it
            were his actual name. He was well-versed in the medical art, both in its theoretical
            foundations and in its practical application; he was an experienced therapeutist and a
            fine surgeon. He won great prestige in the service of the Egyptian caliphs and received
            from them such large sums of money and such precious gifts as far exceeded what accrued
            to any other physician of his time. The caliphs held him in high esteem and bestowed
            boundles favors on him. He lived long and was reckoned among the elite of the medical
            profession. His father, too, was a court physician to the Egyptian caliphs and gained
            fame under their reign.</p>
          <p>Qādī Nafīs al-Dīn b. al-Zubair, who had been acquainted with al-Shaykh al-Sadīd and had
            studied medicine under him, told me as follows: "Al-Shaykh al-Sadīd Raʿīs al-Tibb said
            to me: 'The first caliph to whom I was introduced and who bestowed his favor on me was
            al-ʿAmīr bi-Ahkām Allāh. It came to pass in this way. My father was a physician in his
            service; he had an established position <pb n="725" ed="kopf"/> with him and enjoyed
            great prestige during his reign. I was a youth at the time. For a few dirhams my father
            gave me every day, I would sit daily at the entrance to our house and perform
            bloodlettings on a number of people, until I became quite experienced at the job. I also
            studied the rudiments of the medical art. One day, my father mentioned me to al-ʿAmīr
            and informed him of my abilities, noting especially that I knew how to perform
            bloodletting and had acquired much practice in it. So he sent for me and I went to him
            dressed in sumptuous clothes and riding a spirited mount decked with a sort of gold
            necklace and other ornaments. On reaching the palace in the company of my father, I
            alighted and walked up to where the Caliph was. After I had kissed the ground and paid
            homage to him, he said to me; pointing to a man who was standing in front of him: 'Bleed
            this slave,' I replied: 'At your service.' Then a silver salver was brought, and I bound
            the man's upper arm, the veins of which were prominent, bled him and bandaged the place.
            The Caliph, impressed by my performance, gave orders to present me with lavish gifts and
            sumptuous robes of honor. From that time, I visited the palace regularly and became
            attached to the Caliph's service. The Caliph granted me a monthly allowance, by which I
            was able to support myself as comfortably as I could have wished. In addition, presents
            and monetary awards were constantly showered on me.'"</p>
          <p>Asʿad al-Dīn ʿAbd al-ʿAziz b. Abi al-Ḥasan told me that al-Shaykh al-Sadīd had once
            earned 30,000 dinars in a single day by treating one of the Caliphs. Shaykh Nafīs al-Dīn
            b. al-Zubair told me that when al-Shaykh al-Sadīd appeared before al-Hāfiz bi-Dīn Allāh,
            he earned, there and then about 50,000 dinars and even more, in addition to the gold and
            silver articles in the reception room, which were all given to him as presents. The
            caliph liked to do things in the grand manner, and was very generous.  <pb n="726"
              ed="kopf"/></p>
          <p>Shaykh Rādī al-Dīn al-Rahbī told me as follows: "When al-Muhadhdhab b. al-Naqqāsh, an
            excellent physician, came to Syria from Baghdad, he settled in Damascus for a time, but
            was unable to make a living there. Hearing of the munificence of the Egyptian caliphs
            and the favors they bestowed on those repairing to their court, especially scholars and
            professionals, he left for Egypt. On arriving there, he waited for a few days. He had
            heard of al-Shaykh al-Sadīd, the physician of the caliphs — of his merits, his
            comfortable life, and his virtues. So he went to his house, greeted him and told him
            what his occupation was. He said that the purpose of his coming was to visit him,
            entrust him with all his affairs and draw from the sea of his knowledge. He promised
            that whatever he received from the caliphs would be considered a favor from him and
            al-Shaykh al-Sadīd, placed to his credit all his life. Al-Shaykh al-Sadīd received him
            as befits such a person and honored him greatly. Then he asked him: 'How much would you
            like to be paid if you were to stay in Cairo?' Ibn al-Naqqāsh replied: 'O my lord,
            whatever you think fit and whatever you advise will suffice me.' 'Speak straight out,'
            said al-Shaykh al-Sadīd: 'By Allāh, if a monthly allowance of ten Egyptian dinars were
            granted me, I would consider it a great boon.' 'This sum will not ensure your proper
            upkeep. I shall instruct my manager to assign to you fifteen Egyptian dinars every
            month, a room in my neighborhood — fully furnished and equipped — in which you will
            live, and a beautiful slave girl who will be yours.' Al-Shaykh al-Sadīd then took a
            sumptuous robe of honor and had b. al-Naqqāsh put it on; then ordered his servant to
            fetch a mule from among his best mounts, and presented him with it. Thus he said to him:
            'The pay will reach you every month, and whatever you need, books or other things, will
            be supplied to you according to your wishes. But I ask you not to stop visiting me and
            associating with me; and you should not seek any favors from the Caliph and not frequent
            any of the state dignitaries.  <pb n="727" ed="kopf"/>Ibn al-Naqqash agreed to these
            conditions, and nothing changed in his situation as long as he stayed in Cairo.
            Eventually he returned to Syria and lived in Damascus until his death."</p>
          <p>I say: al-Shaykh al-Sadīd studied medicine under Abū Nasr ʿAdnān b. al-Ainzarbī. He
            never ceased to enjoy the esteem of the caliphs, and the reputation he gained with them
            grew steadily, from the time of al-Amir bi-Ahkām Allāh to the last days of al-ʿAdīd
            bi-Allāh. As youth he was, with his father, in the service of al-Amir bi-Ahkām Allāh,
            i.e., Abū ʿAlī al-Mansūr b. Abi al-Qāsim Aḥmad al-Mustaʿlī bi-Allāh b. al-Mustansir.
            When al-Amīr fell in battle — at al-Jazīra, on Tuesday, the 4th of Dhū 'l-Qaʿdah of the
            year 524/1129 after being Caliph for twenty eight years, nine months and a few days —
            al-Shaykh al-Sadīd entered the service of al-Hāfiz Li-Dīn Allāh, i.e., Abū 'l-Maimūn
            ʿAbd al-Masīd b. al-Amīr Abū 'l-Qasim Muḥammad b. al-Imām al-Mustansir bi-Allāh, who was
            recognized as sovereign the very day al-Amīr fell in battle. He remained in al-Hāfiz
            li-Dīn Allāh's service until the latter's death, which took place on the 5th of Jumādā
            II in the year 540/1149. Thereafter he entered the service of al-Zāfir bi-Amr Allāh,
            i.e., Abū Mansūr Ismāʿīl b. al-Hafiz li-Dīn Allāh, who was recognized as sovereign on
            the night preceding the 5th of Jumādā II in the year 544/1149, upon his father's death.
            Al-Shaykh al-Sadīd remained in the service of al-Zāfir bi-Amr Allāh until the latter
            fell in battle on the 29th of Muharram of the year 549/1154. Thereafter he entered the
            service of al-Fāʿiz bi-Nasr Allāh, i.e., Abū 'l-Qāsim ʿĪsā b. al-Zāfir bi-Amr Allāh, who
            was recognized as sovereign on the 30th of Muharram of the year 549. He remained in the
            service of al-Fāʿiz Bi-Nasr Allāh until the latter died in the year five hundred and . .
            . [lacuna]. Thereafter he entered the service of al-ʿĀdid li-Dīn Allāh, i.e., Abū
            Muḥammad ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Maulā Abū al-Hāssāji Yūsuf b. al-Imām al-Hāfiz li-Dīn Allāh,
            with whom <pb n="728" ed="kopf"/> he remained until the latter died on the 9th of
            Muharram, 567/1171, the last Egyptian caliph. Al-Shaykh al-Sadīd thus lived to see and
            serve five Egyptian caliphs, during whose reign he received valuable gifts and
            innumerable favors.</p>
          <p>Thereafter, when al-Malik al-Nāsir Salāh al-Dīn Yūsuf b. Ayyūb seized power in Cairo
            and made himself ruler of the country, al-Shaykh al-Sadīd lost the many favors, the
            lavish gifts and the generous monthly allowance for the rest of his stay in Cairo —
            until he went to Syria — although Salāh al-Dīn would avail himself of his medical
            services and follow his prescriptions and advice more faithfully than those of other
            physicians. He continued as head physician right up to his death.</p>
          <p>In Cairo, al-Shaykh al-Sadīd resided near Zawīla Gate, in a house which was in a very
            good state of repair and profusely adorned. During the latter part of his life he was
            visited by a great mishap; his house caught fire and he lost a large quantity of
            furniture, household wares and other belongings. When part of the house had been
            destroyed, large earthenware vessels and casks filled with</p>

          <p>Egyptian gold coins fell down and broke and, in the turmoil of the conflagration and
            destruction, the gold spilled in all directions, before the eyes of the people, some
            coins having been melted by the fire. The damage amounted to thousands of dinars.</p>
          <p>Qādī Nafīs al-Dīn b. al-Zubair told me that shortly before this event, al-Shaykh
            al-Sadīd had dreamt that the house in which he lived burnt down. Much perturbed he
            decided to move and actually began to build a new house near the old one. He urged the
            builders to make haste, and when only one room remained to be completed so that the
            might be able to move in, the old house caught fire. This happened on the 26th of Jumādā
            II in the year 579/1183. After his death the new house passed to Sāhib Safī al-Dīn b.
            Sukr, the Vizier of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr b. Ayyūb. It is now named after Safī
            al-Dīn.  <pb n="729" ed="kopf"/></p>
          <p>I have copied the following poem from the handwriting of Fahr al-Kutt'ab Hasan b. ʿAlī
            b. Ibrāhīm al-Guwainī, the secretary. The composed for al-Shaykh al-Sadīd, of whom he
            was a close and loving friend, comforting him after the destruction of his house and the
            loss of his valuables. [The poem follows].</p>

          <p> i.e., al-Shaykh al-Muwaffaq Shams al-Riʿāsa Abū al-ʿAshāir Hibat Allāh b. Zain b.
            Hasan b. Ifrāʿīm Yaʿqūb b. Ismāʿīl b. Jumaiʿ, the Israelite, was a famous physician and
            scholar and most distinguished personality. He concerned himself with various sciences
            and acquired a sound knowledge of them, making special efforts to master the medical art
            and becoming a good therapeutist. He was also an excellent writer.</p>
          <p>He studied medicine under Shaykh al-Muwaffaq Abū Nasr ʿAdnān b. al-ʿAinzarbī, to whom
            he attached himself for a time. He was born and bred in Fustāt, served al-Malik al-Nāsir
            Salāh al-Dīn Yūsuf b. Ayyūb, gained great prestige during his reign and attained a high
            and influential position with him. Salāh al-Dīn fully trusted in his medical skill, and
            he prepared for him the theriac known as al-Fārūq.</p>
          <p>Ibn Jumaiʿ gave public lectures for those anxious to study medicine with him. He was a
            man of great ambition. Al-Shaykh al-Sadīd b. Abī al-Bayān told me that he had studied
            medicine under b. Jumaiʿ; he also said that Ibn Jumaiʿ was himself an assiduous student,
            who had gained supreme mastery of the theory of medicine and excelled in its
            practice.</p>
          <p>I say: This opinion is confirmed by his works, which are excellently written and full
            of useful practical information.</p>
          <p>He took a special interest in the Arabic language and made a point of verifying the
            exact meaning of words. He never gave a lecture without having al-Gauharī's dictionary,
            "al-Sihāh," at hand, and <pb n="730" ed="kopf"/> whenever he came across a word whose
            meaning he was not sure of, he looked it up, relying on al-Gawhari's explanation. One
            day, I was at the house of al-Sāhib Jamāl al-Dīn Yaḥyā b. Matrūh in Damascus. It was
            during the reign of al-Malik al-Sālih Najm al-Dīn Ayyūb, the ruler of Egypt and Syria,
            and al-Sahib Jamāl al-Dīn, who wielded the sword and the pen with equal skill and who
            had 200 horsemen at his disposal served at that time as his vizier for the whole
            kingdom. In the course of our conversation he was good enough to remark: "No one before
            you has written a book comparable to yours on the classes of physicians. Do you mention
            in it our colleagues, the physicians of Egypt?" When I replied in the affirmative, he
            continued: "It would seem to me that you say that, among the earlier ones, there was
            none like Ibn Ridwān, and among the later ones, none like b. Gūmai. "This is correct, O
            my lord," I replied.</p>
          <p>A man from Egypt told me: "One day, when Ibn Jumaiʿ was sitting in his shop [pharmacy?]
            near the Candle Market in Fustāt, a funeral procession passed by. After looking at it,
            he shouted to the kinsfolk of the dead, that their beloved was not dead and that if they
            interred him, they would be burying a living person. The people stood open-mouthed at
            this, astonished at his words, and refused to believe him. Then they said to one
            another: 'It will not harm us to check what he says. If he is right, so much the better;
            and if he is wrong, nothing will have changed.' So they called to him to approach and
            said to him: 'Prove what you have told us.' He instructed them to return home, remove
            the shrouds from the body and carry it into the bathroom. There he poured some hot water
            on it to warm it up, and treated it with aromatic substances, which had resulted in his
            sneezing. So the people were not able to note some sign of sensation in it; when it made
            some slight movements, Ibn Jumaiʿ said: 'Rejoice at his return to life.' He then
            continued treating him until he recovered consiousness and felt well. This was the
            beginning of Ibn Jumaiʿ's fame as a <pb n="731" ed="kopf"/> practitioner and scientist.
            It seemed as if he had performed a miracle. Later, he was asked how he had known that
            the body carried on a bier and covered with shrouds still had some life in it, and he
            replied: 'I looked at his feet and saw that they were turned upward, whereas the feet of
            those who are dead are stretched out flat. So I guessed that he was alive, and my guess
            proved correct.'"</p>
          <p>I say: There lived in Cairo Ibn al-Munajjīm al-Misrī, a famous poet with a malicious
            tongue. He composed numerous satirical poems on Ibn Jumaiʿ, one of which reads as
            follows:</p>
          <quote><p><l>Ibn Jumaiʿ's medical knowledge is tainted with stupidity. </l><l> Owing to
                which he misapplies the medical lore of the Messiah. </l><l> He could not diagnose
                the illness from the patient's urine </l><l> Contained in the phial, even if he
                rinsed his mouth with it. </l><l> The most astonishing thing is that he always takes
                </l><l> A fee from the next-of-kin for killing a patient.</l></p></quote>
          <p>Another poem of his:</p>
          <quote><p><l>Leave Ibn Jumaiʿ alone with his falsehoods</l><l> And his pretensions of
                being skilled in medicine and geometry; </l><l> For he is nothing but a fool who had
                dropped from somewhere, </l><l> And when he settles in a place, he brings only
                disaster to it.</l></p></quote>
          <p>Still another:</p>
          <quote><p><l>Everything you claim is but lie and distortion. </l><l> You said that your
                father was Jumaiʿ the Jew, </l><l> But Jumaiʿ the Jew is not your father;</l><l>

          <p> His honorific name was al-Sadīd. He was a Karaite Jew, well-versed in the medical
            science and skilled in its practice. Many professional observations and praiseworthy
            achievements are reported of him. He served the Egyptian caliphs during the latter part
            of their reign, and thereafter al-Malik al-Nāsir Salāh al-Dīn, who followed his advice,
            submitted to his treatment and placed his trust in him. He received from him a generous
            salary and numerous gifts.</p>
          <p>Abū al-Bayān b. al-Mudawwir lived long. Toward the end of his life he became disabled
            due to old age and overexertion in the performing of his professional duties. So
            al-Malik al-Nāsir Salāh al-Dīn granted him a monthly pension of 24 Egyptian dinars in
            order that he might be able to stay at home and be spared the burden of duty. Thus he
            remained on his pension for about twenty years. But while he was confined to his home,
            neither did he abstain from practicing medicine nor was his house free from students and
            patients who came to receive his prescriptions. But he did not make house visits, except
            to patients who were very close to him. In this respect I have <pb n="733" ed="kopf"/>
            been told that when the Emir Ibn Munqid who had arrived from Yemen sticken with dropsy,
            invited him to come and cure him, he made excuses although the distance to be covered
            was small. He visited him only after al-Qādī al-Fādil had sent his manager, Ibn Sanāʿ
            al-Mulk, who entreated him to call on the patient. He prescribed for him the medicine
            generally administered in such cases.</p>
          <p>Abū al-Bayān b. al-Mudawwir lived 83 years. He died in Cairo in the year 580/1184. His
            disciples included Zain al-Hassāb. He wrote a book on his medical observations.</p>

          <p> honorifically named al-Muhadhdhab [i.e., Muhadhdhab al-Dīn], was a renowned physician
            and savant. He was a man of comprehensive knowledge and remarkable achievements and an
            excellent therapeutist. He was a Jew. He became known both as a general practitioner and
            an eye-doctor, but ophthalmology was his main concern. He made an excellent living and
            was so meticulous that, for the greater part of his time his students were busy studying
            under his guidance. When going out or visiting a patient, he would always ride. He died
            in Cairo in the year 584/1188. His soil, Abū al-Faraj, who was also a general
            practitioner and an eye-doctor, embraced Islam.</p>
          <p>My father told me as follows: "There came to Abū-al-Fadāʿil b. al-Nāgid a Jewish friend
            who was in dire straits and asked for his support. Abū-al-Fadāʿil had him sit near his
            house and said to him: 'Whatever I earn today shall be yours.' Then he rode away, making
            the tour of the sick and those in need of eye treatment. Upon his return, he took out a
            large number of tied-up paper bags from among hi ophthalmological equipment, and opened
            them one by one. Some contained one dinar or several several dinars, others Nāsirī or
            Sawād dirhams, the total value being about 300 Sawād dirhams. He gave the money to that
            man and said: 'By God, as regards all those <pb n="734" ed="kopf"/> paper bags, I do not
            know who gave me gold coins and who gave me dirhams, or whether they were many or few.
            All I receive I put among my ophthalmological instruments. This suggests an abundant
            income.'"</p>

          <p> was an outstanding savant and celebrated physician. He was an Israelite. He gained
            fame by his professional skill and his excellent knowledge of general medicine,
            ophthalmology and surgery. He was gentle, amiable and fond of jesting, composed poems
            and played the gītara. He attended al-Malik al-Nāsir Salāh al-Dīn when the latter stayed
            in Egypt, and stood high in his favor.</p>
          <p>There was in Damascus a sūfī jurist, a friend of Muḥammad b. Yaḥyā, who lived in the
            sūfī hospice "al-Sumaisatī.'' He was known as al-Khaubashānī, and his honorific name was
            al-Najm [Najm al-Dīn]. He was acquainted with Najm al-Dīn Ayyub and with his brother,
            Asad al-Dīn. He was stolid, austere in his ways, inflexible as regards religion, and
            followed the law to the letter.</p>
          <p>When Asad al-Dīn went to Egypt, al-Khaubshānī followed him and took up quarters in a
            mosque near the residence of the viziers, which is now known as the Mosque of
            al-Khaubshānī. Endowed with a sharp tongue he would defame and curse the inhabitants of
            the palace instead of praising God. Whenever he saw a dhimmī riding, he <pb n="735"
              ed="kopf"/> sought to kill him, so that dhimmīs took care to avoid him. One day he saw
            Ibn Shūʿa riding and threw a stone at him which hit his eye and knocked it out.</p>
          <p>Ibn Shūʿa died in Cairo in the year 579/1183. He composed poems, of which the
            following, about al-Najm when he knocked out his eye, was recited to me by Qādī Nafīs
            al-Dīn al-Zubair, who had heard it from the author himself:</p>
          <quote><p><l>Be not amazed if the eyes become tired</l><l> By looking at the rays of the
                sun; for this is a thing well known.</l><l> But wonder how my eye grew blind from
                looking</l><l> At a "star" [al-Najm] which is tiny and hardly
            visible.</l></p></quote>
          <p>Here is another of his poems, satirizing Ibn Jumaiʿ the Jew, which was also recited to
            me by Nafīs al-Dīn, who had heard it from the author:</p>
          <quote><p><l>O Ibn Jumaiʿ, by claiming to be a physician and a geometer, </l><l> You have
                uttered an obvious lie.</l><l> If you are learned in medicine, why did your
                abilities fail you</l><l> In curing an ailment deeply hidden within you?</l><l> For
                treating it, you need a doctor who cures</l><l> With a sharp knife, two spans
                long.</l><l> Even so, you might not be restored to health.</l><l> Answer, therefore,
                this question with understanding and thought</l><l> What is the geometrical figure

          <p>Another poem:</p>
          <quote><p><l>A meadow abundantly watered by the rains of spring</l><l> Has favored us with
                an embroidery which no hand can imitate.</l><l> Its sparkling yellow and its white

            Galen said about them. Among the physicians of his time, he was the foremost expert in
            the preparation of drugs, knowing the exact quantifies and weights to be employed. When
            patients affected with various, even rare diseases came to consult him, he dictated on
            the spot prescriptions for compound drugs — pills, powders and liquids — according to
            what was needed. The drugs were always well compounded and highly effective.</p>
          <p>His teacher of medicine was al-Ra'īs Hibat Allāh b. Jumaiʿ, the Jew, but he also
            studied under Abū 'l-Fadā'il b. al-Nāqid. He was in the service of al-Malik al-ʿAdil Abū
            Bakr b. Ayyūb. I have come across the following lines about him:</p>

          <p>He lived more than eighty years. Toward the end of his life his eyesight became weak.

          <p> This was the chief and master Abū ʿAmr ʿUtmān b. Hibat Allāh b. Aḥmad b. ʿAqil
            al-Qaisī, known as b. Abi-al-Hawāfir, the most celebrated of physicians, the lord of
            savants, peerless in his time. He mastered the medical art, distinguishing himself in
            both its theory and practice, and also engaged in the study of literature, in which he
            took a keen interest. He composed a great number of poems, strictly adhering to the
            rules of prosody and using admirable metaphors. He was — may Allāh have mercy upon him —
            a most virtuous man of good Arab stock, who gained fame by his achievements and
            excellent character. He bestowed favors and lavished gifts upon high and low.</p>
          <p>He was born and bred in Damascus, studied medicine under the Imām Muhadhdhab al-Dīn b.
            al-Naqqāsh and Shaykh Radī al-Dīn al-Rahbī and served as a physician to al-Malik
            al-ʿAzīm ʿUtmān, the son of al-Malik al-Nāsir Salāh al-Dīn, with whom he stayed in
            Egypt. Appointed chief of physicians by al-Malik al-ʿAzīz, he remained in his service
            and enjoyed his favors and numerous gifts until al-Malik al-ʿAzīz died — may Allāh have
            mercy upon him. He died in Cairo on the night of Sunday, the 20th of Muharram of the
            year 595/1198. Ibn Abī 'l-Hawāfir continued to reside in Egypt, entering the service of
            al-Malik al-Kāmil Muḥammad b. Abī Bakr b. Ayyūb, with whom he abided for several years.
            He died in Cairo.  <pb n="741" ed="kopf"/></p>
          <p>A friend of mine told me as follows: "One day, when Ibn Abī 'l-Hawāfir was riding out,
            he saw, in a certain part of the town, a vendor of boiled chick-peas sitting on a stone
            bench, while a Jewish eye-doctor was standing in front of him, holding in his hand the
            kohl container and the style for the collyrium and treating the eyes of this vendor. On
            seeing the doctor in that position, b. Abī l-Hawāfir directed his mule toward him, hit
            him on the head with his whip and swore at him; then, while the eye-doctor walked along
            with him, he said: 'Even though you are low yourself, the profession has its honor. You
            should have sat down by his side, while treating his eyes, rather than stand before a
            simple vendor of chick-peas.' The other promised not to do it again and went away."</p>
          <p>I say: Shaykh Jamāl al-Dīn b. Abi 'l-Hawāfir had a number of disciples who
            distinguished themselves in the medical art. The most talented of these and the one who
            acquired the broadest knowledge was my learned paternal uncle, Rashīd al-Dīn ʿAlī b.

          <head><persName>Abū Sulaymān Dā'ud b. Abī 'l-Munā b. Abī Fanā</persName></head>
          <p> was a Christian physician in Egypt in the days of the Caliphs, with whom he stood in
            high favor. He excelled in medical theory and practice and distinguished himself in the
            sciences. He was a native of Jerusalem, but settled in Egypt. He possessed an extensive
            knowledge of astrology.</p>
          <p>The savant Rashīd al-Dīn Abū Hulaiqa b. al-Fāris [Al-Fāris being the son of the said
            Abu Sulaymān] told me that he had heard the following story about his grandfather, Abū
            Sulaymān Dā'ud, from the mouth of the Emir Majd al-Dīn, brother of the jurist ʿĪsā, when
            Majd al-Dīn was talking to the Sultan al-Malik al-Kāmil in Shirmasāh during a visit he
            paid him after the death of al-Malik al ʿĀdil, when the Crusaders were besieging the
            fortress of Damietta.</p>
          <p>The savant Abu Sulaymān lived in the days of the caliphs. He had five sons. When King
            Marī arrived in Egypt, he was much impressed by Abū Sulaymān's medical skill and asked
            the Caliph to give the doctor to him. So the Caliph transferred Abū Sulaymān and his
            five sons to Jerusalem. King Marī had a leprous son, for whom Abu Sulaymān prepared the
            theriac known as al-Farūq.  <pb n="745" ed="kopf"/></p>
          <p>Subsequently Abū Sulaymān adopted a monastic way of life and left his eldest son, the
            savant al-Muhadhdhab Abū Saʿīd, in charge of his house and his other sons.</p>
          <p>One day, the said King of the Crusaders arrested the jurist ʿĪsā in Jerusalem. ʿĪsā
            fell ill during his imprisonent and the King sent Abū Sulaymān to attend him. Abū
            Sulaymān found his patient in a cistern, fettered with iron chains. He returned to the
            King and said: "That man is used to a life of ease. Even if you gave him the elixir of
            life, he would not profit by it in his present condition." Said the King: "What am I to
            do with Him?" Abū Sulaymān replied: "The King should take him out of the cistern, remove
            his fetters and honor him; he needs no other treatment." Replied the King: "I fear that
            he might flee, and the taxes due from him amount to a large sum." Said Abū Sulaymān:
            "Give him into my custody, and I shall assume responsibility for him." The King
            answered: "Take him, and when his taxes arrive, you will receive a thousand dinars out
            of them." Abū Sulaymān went away, took ʿĪsā from the cistern, removed his chains and
            assigned to him a place in his house. ʿĪsā lived there for six months, during which time
            Abū Sulaymān tended him with the utmost care. When the taxes arrived, the King ordered
            the savant Abū Saʿīd (Abū Sulaymān's eldest son) to fetch ʿĪsā, who appeared in the
            company of Abū Sulaymān. The taxes were in some bags in front of the king, who gave one
            of the bags to Abū Sulaymān, as he had promised. Taking the money, Abū Sulaymān asked:
            "O my lord, these thousand dinars — may I dispose of them as owners do with their
            property?" On receiving an affirmative reply, Abū Sulaymān gave the money to ʿĪsā there
            and then, and said to him: "I understand that these taxes have been collected without
            leaving you anything: you may have even had to take a loan in order to pay them. So take
            from me these thousand dinars for your traveling expenses." ʿĪsā accepted the money and
            betook himself to al-Malik al-Nāsir.</p>
          <p>It happened that the said savant, Abū Sulaymān Dā'ud, read in the stars that al-Malik
            al-Nāsir would conquer Jerusalem on a <pb n="746" ed="kopf"/> certain day of a certain
            month of a certain year and that he would enter the city through the al-Rahma Gate. One
            of Abū Sulaymān's five sons, namely al-Fāris Abū 'l-Khair, had been brought up with the
            King of Jerusalem's leprous son, who had taught him horsemanship, and when that prince
            was crowned king, al-Fāris entered his service as a knight. Unlike his four brothers,
            who were physicians, he became a soldier. Abū Sulaymān told this son of his to travel to
            al-Malik al-Nāsir as his messenger, and convey to him the good news that he would
            conquer Jerusalem at such-and-such a time. In compliance with this order, al-Fāris set
            out on his way to al-Malik al-Nāsir. He reached him in Gaza in the year 580/1184, at a
            time that people were paying him homage. So he went to the aforementioned jurist, who
            rejoiced to see him. In his company he visited al-Malik al-Nāsir and gave him his
            father's message. The Sultan, very pleased, bestowed upon him a splendid reward and gave
            him a yellow flag and an arrow of the same color, saying: "When Allāh enables me to do
            what you said, put this yellow flag and arrow upon your house, and the whole of the
            quarter in which you live will be spared, being protected by your house."</p>
          <p>When the time came, it all happened as the said savant had predicted. ʿĪsā, the jurist,
            entered al-Fāris' house in order to protect it, and in the whole of Jerusalem it was the
            only house, whose inhabitants were spared imprisonment, death and the levy of
            contributions. Al-Malik al-Nāsir doubled the income which Abū Sulaymān's sons had been
            receiving from the Europeans and sent out a decree to all his mainland and island
            possessions, exempting Abū Sulaymān's family from all the dues imposed upon the
            Christians. They have been exempt from them to this day.</p>
          <p>Abū Sulaymān died after the following occurrence: al-Malik al-Nāsir called him to his
            presence, stood up before him and said: "You are a divinely blessed old man. You sent me
            good tidings, and everything you predicted came true. So beg something from me.  <pb
              n="747" ed="kopf"/>Abū Sulaymān replied: "I beg that you may protect my children."
            Al-Malik al-Nāsir did so and later entrusted them to al-Malik al-ʿAdil, enjoining him to
            treat them hospitably and see to it that they were in his retinue and that of his sons.
            And so it was.</p>
          <p>The conquest of Jerusalem by Sultan al-Malik al-Nāsir Salāh al-Dīn Yūsuf b. Ayyūb took
            place on the 27th of Rajab in the year 583/1187.</p>

            outstanding in its practice. He also held a high position in the state. Sultan al-Malik
            al-ʿAdil assigned him to the service of his son, al-Malik al-Muʿazzam, honored him
            greatly and ordered that, despite his perfect health, he should always be mounted when
            entering one of his four fortresses, namely al-Kirk, Jaʿbar, al-Rūhā and Damascus, and
            so he did.</p>
          <p>Abū Saʿīd b. Abī Sulaymān served as physician to al-Malik al-Nāsir Salāh al-Dīn and to
            al-Malik al-ʿĀdil. He moved to Egypt and remained there until his death, which occurred

            Sulaymān Dā'ud mastered medical theory and practice and was a good therapeutist. He
            enjoyed great prestige with the ruling dynasty. After studying medicine under his
            brother Abū Saʿīd, he became himself a renowned physician. Sultan al-Malik al-ʿAdil
            assigned him to the service of his son, al-Malik al-Kāmil, where he remained, enjoying
            the latter's favor and high esteem, he amassed a fortune under his reign. Not only did
            he receive some country estates and other landed property from as fiefs, but the
            sovereign constantly showered lavish gifts on him. <pb n="748" ed="kopf"/> Al-Malik
            al-ʿAdil, too, relied upon Abū Shākir for medical treatment, declaring him to be a fine
            therapeutist. Like his brother, Abū Shākir entered all the royal fortresses — al-Kirk,
            Jaʿbar, al-Rūhā, Damascus and Cairo — mounted, despite his perfect health. How much he
            was honored is shown by the following occurrence when al-Malik al-Kāmil had taken up
            residence in the Cairo palace and lodged Abū Shākir in the same building while al-Malik
            al-ʿAdil resided in the mansion of the vizierate. One day, al-Malik al-Kāmil rode out on
            a mule on a relay and went as far as Bain al-Qasrain. There he changed mounts, sent the
            mule he had been riding to the quarters of Abū Shākir at the palace with instructions to
            mount it and leave the palace. He himself waited in Bain al-Qasrain until Abū Shākir
            joined him. Then he took him by the hand and proceeded with him to the mansion of the
            vizierate, talking all the while; and all the emirs walked in front of al-Malik
            al-Kāmil.</p>

          <p> i.e., the venerable savant and scholar Rashīd al-Dīn Abū 'l-Wahsh b. al-Fāris 'l-Khair
            b. Abī Sulaymān Dā'ud b. Abi 'l-Munā b. Abī Fanā, known as Abū Hulaiqa. He was unequaled
            in his time in the medical art and the philosophical disciplines, familiar with sciences
            and letters, a good therapeutist, skillful in the application of medicines, gentle with
            the sick, anxious to do good, observant of the faith to which he adhered and eager to
            fulfill his religious duties. I met him several times and found him a person of such
            therapeutic skill, amiable behavior and perfect character as is beyond description. He
            studied medicine at first in Damascus, under his paternal uncle, Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Abū
            Saʿīd, and later in Egypt. He also studied with my teacher Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd
            al-Raḥīm b. ʿAlī, may Allāh have mercy upon him, and tirelessly strove to perfect
            himself in the sciences.</p>
          <p>Born in the fortress of Jaʿbar in the year 591/1194, he spent seven or eight years of
            his boyhood at al-Ruhā. His father had him wear the clothes of a soldier like himself.
            In al-Ruhā, he lived in a house called the house of b. al-Zaʿfarānī, near the Shaʿ Gate,
            adjacent to the residence of the Sultan. Once, when al-Malik al-Kāmil had entered the
            bath in that house, Rashīd al-Dīn's father, al-Fāris, gave the boy some fruit and
            rose-water and ordered him to take them to the Sultan. Rashīd al-Dīn did as told — when
            the Sultan came out of the bath, he delivered the gifts. The Sultan took them and went
            to the treasure-house, where he emptied the plates of the fruit and filled them with
            pieces of precious fabric, which he sent by his servant to Rashīd al-Dīn's father. He
            then took the boy — who was at that time about eight years old — by the hand and went
            with him to al-Malik al-ʿAdil. The latter, looking at the boy whom he had never seen
            before, noticed the resemblance and asked al-Malik al-Kāmil: "O Muḥammad, is this the
            son of al-Fāris?" On receiving <pb n="750" ed="kopf"/> an affirmative reply he said:
            "Give him to me." Al-Malik al-Kāmil lifted up the boy and placed him in front of his
            father, who took his hand and talked to him a long time. Then, turning to the boy's
            father, who was among those in attendance, he said: "This son of yours is a clever boy.
            Do not teach him the military craft. Soldiers we have many, but yours is an
            exceptionally gifted family, and I have derived much benefit from your medical skill.
            Send him to Damascus, to the savant Abū Saʿīd, that he may teach him medicine." Al-Fāris
            obeyed the order, fitted him out and sent him to Damascus, where the boy stayed a whole
            year, during which time he learnt Hippocrates' "Aphorisms" and "Prognostics."
            ["Tāqaddāmāt al-Maʿarifa"] by heart. In the year 599/1202 he went to Cairo and stayed
            there, serving as physician to al-Malik al-Kāmil, who held him in high esteem, honored
            him greatly and bestowed many favors and gifts upon him. He had a fief in Egypt, which
            had originally been given to his paternal uncle, Muwaffaq al-Dīn Abū Shākir: when the
            latter died, al-Malik al-Kāmil transferred it to Rashīd al-Dīn. It consisted of half of
            a locality named al-ʿAzīzīya or al-Kharba, in one of the Eastern provinces. </p>
          <p>Rashīd al-Dīn continued in the service of al-Malik al-Kāmil, until the latter died, may
            Allāh have mercy upon him. Thereafter he served al-Malik al-Kāmil's son, al-Malik
            al-Sālih Najm al-Dīn Ayyūb, until that ruler died, may Allāh have mercy upon him. Later
            he served al-Malik al-Sālih's son, al-Malik al-Muʿazzam Tūrānshāh, and when the latter
            was killed — may Allāh have mercy upon him —on Monday, the 27th of Muharram of the year
            648/1250, and the Turkish dynasty rose to power, conquering lands and subduing kingdoms,
            he entered its service and was granted the same privileges as he had enjoyed before. The
            last ruler of that dynasty whom he served was al-Malik al-Zāhir Rukn al-Dīn Baibars
            al-Malik al-Sālihī, under whom he retained the same position and privileges as before.

          </p>
          <p>There are some interesting reports about Rashīd al-Dīn Abū Hulaiqa's medical activities
            and many stories showing him as different from other physicians. Here is one such story:
            A woman of the royal household in al-ʿAbbāsa once fell ill. Now the sovereign would have
            no one but Rashīd al-Dīn attend him and his beloved womenfolk and children. So Rashīd
            al-Dīn undertook to cure the sick woman, by himself. After treating her for a few days,
            some urgent business forced him to leave her and go to Cairo, where he stayed for
            eighteen days. On his return to al-ʿAbbāsa, he found that the other court physicians
            were attending the patient, and when he jointed them, they said: "This woman is going to
            die. We should inform the Sultan of her condition lest he be shocked by her sudden
            death." Said he: "In my opinion, she is not mortally ill. With the help of Allāh she
            will recover." One of the physicians — the most senior of them — retorted to the young
            Rashīd al-Dīn: "I am older than you, and have treated more patients. So agree that we
            send a message to the Sultan." But Rashīd al - Dīn refused, and when some of the
            physicians insisted that the Sultan be informed, he said: "If you think you must send
            that message, do it in your own name and leave me out of it." So the physicians wrote to
            the Sultan, announcing the woman's impending death. Thereupon the Sultan sent a
            messenger over with a carpenter, who was to made a coffin for her. When the messenger
            came to the door, accompanied by the carpenter, Rashīd al-Dīn asked him, while the other
            physicians were sitting about: "What is that carpenter doing here? "The messenger
            answered: "He is to make a coffin for your patient." Said Rashīd al-Dīn: "Will you put
            her in while she is still alive?" "No," said the messenger, "only when she is dead."
            Said Rashīd al-Dīn: "Go back with that carpenter and tell the Sultan in my name that the
            woman will not die of her present illness." The messenger returned to the Sultan and
            delivered the message. When night came, the Sultan summoned <pb n="752" ed="kopf"/>
            Rashīd al-Dīn via a servant carrying a candle and a slip of paper, on which he had
            written in his own handwriting: "The son of al-Fāris is to appear before me." He used
            that name, because Rashīd al-Dīn was not yet called Abū Hulaiqa, which name was given
            him later by Sultan al-Malik al-Kāmil. It came about in this way: One day he was sitting
            at the door with the other physicians, when the Sultan ordered his servant to fetch the
            doctor. The servant asked which one he meant and he said: "Abū Hulaiqa." From that day
            on both Rashīd al-Dīn and his paternal uncle were known among the people by that name,
            until this epithet eventually became forgotten.</p>
          <p>When Rashīd al-Dīn appeared before the Sultan, the latter asked him: "Was it you that
            forestalled the making of the coffin?" "Yes." "Why did you arrive at a different
            conclusion from all the other physicians?" — "Because I know exactly what her temper is
            like in time of illness, and they do not. There is nothing to fear for her from this
            disease." — "Go and treat her, and take good care of her." — So Rashīd al-Dīn treated
            her and she recovered. The Sultan then married her off, and she subsequently gave birth
            to a large number of children.</p>
          <p>One of Rashīd al-Dīn's accomplishments was that he knew the beat of al-Malik al-Kāmil's
            pulse. One day, the Sultan hid behind a screen with the sick women who were to be
            treated. Rashīd al-Dīn felt their pulse and prescribed a medicine for each of them. When
            the Sultan's turn came, he recognized him by his pulse and said: "This is the pulse of
            my lord, the Sultan. Thank God, it is all right." The Sultan was greatly amazed, and his
            esteem for Rashīd al-Dīn rose still further.</p>
          <p>Another incident involving him and the Sultan was as follows: The Sultan once ordered
            him to prepare a quantity of the theriac known as al-Fārūq, and he busied himself with
            this task a long time, working even at night, until he had determined all the
            ingredients in accordance with the instructions given by the masters of the <pb n="753"
              ed="kopf"/> medical science, Hippocrates and Galen. Meanwhile, the Sultan became
            affected with a catarrh of the teeth, for which he was bled while at Birkat al-Fīl for
            recreation. Afterwards he went to the citadel, where the physician al-Asʿad b. Abi
            'l-Ḥasan undertook his treatment, since Rashīd al-Dīn was busy preparing the theriac.
            Al-Asʿad treated the Sultan for a while, but his condition became steadily worse. When
            he complained to al-Asʿad about it, the latter said: "I have no choice but to bleed
            you." Said the Sultan: "Am I to be bled again only three days after the last time? Call
            Abū Hulaiqa!" When the latter presented himself, the Sultan complained to him about his
            condition and told him that al-Asʿad had advised bloodletting. He asked Rashīd al-Dīn
            whether he should undergo this or take medicine. Said Rashīd al-Dīn: "O my lord, your
            body is pure, thank God, and your condition is not very serious." Said the Sultan: "How
            can you say 'not serious,' when I am wracked with pain? I neither sleep at night nor
            have peace by day." Said Rashīd al-Dīn: "My lord should rub his teeth with the theriac
            which his servant has brought in a little silver vessel and with God's help, he will see
            a miracle." Then Rashīd al-Dīn went away. He had hardly left when a message written by
            the Sultan himself reached him, reading as follows: "O physician, I did as you told me
            and all my pain vanished immediately." Rashīd al-Dīn received the message in the
            presence of al-Asʿad, the physician who had treated the Sultan first. Al-Asʿad said to
            him: "By Allāh, I am not good enough to treat kings. Only you are fit." Al-Malik
            al-Kāmil then went to his treasure house and sent Rashīd al-Dīn some precious robes of
            honor and a good quantity of gold.</p>
          <p>Here is another story about Rashīd al-Dīn. After spending a long time preparing the
            theriac al-Farūq — as it was difficult to obtain the proper ingredients from distant
            countries — he prepared a less complicated theriac. The components of which are to be
            found <pb n="754" ed="kopf"/> everywhere. In preparing it, his intention was not to
            ingratiate himself with the sovereign or to gain money or worldly fame, but to find
            favor with God by aiding all His creatures and showing mercy to all. So he freely
            dispensed it to the sick, bringing relief to the paralyzed and straightening crooked
            hands on the spot: it produced additional natural warmth in the sinews, strengthened
            them and dissolved the phlegm contained in them. The patients at once felt relief, and
            colic pains subsided immediately after evacuation.</p>
          <p>Once, he passed by the keeper of the gate situated between the two walls of Cairo, a
            man named ʿAlī, who was lying on his back unable to turn over from one side to the
            other. This man bewailed his condition to Rashid al-Dīn, who gave him a dose of the
            theriac and then ascended to the citadel to tend the sick. When he returned at three
            o'clock, the palsy-stricken man stood up, ran after him and blessed him. When he told
            him to sit down, the man said: 'I am tired of sitting. Let me enjoy myself!"</p>
          <p>Yet another story: Al-Malik al-Kāmil had a muezzin named Amīn al-Dīn Jaʿfar, who was
            suffering from a stone which blocked the discharge of urine. The resulting pains were so
            violent that he thought he was dying. He sent a note to al-Malik al-Kāmil, informing him
            of his condition and asking permission to go home to be cured. When he got home, he had
            all the outstanding physicians of the age come to him. Each of them prescribed a
            medicine, which however, was of no avail. He then sent for Abū Hulaiqa. The latter gave
            him a dose of his theriac, which, as soon as it reached the stomach, exerted its power
            upon the stone and broke it up so that it came out with the urine, stained with the
            color of the medicament. The patient recovered immediately, returned to his post and
            called for the midday prayer. That day, the Sultan was encamped near Jīza on the
            outskirts of Cairo, and when he heard the voice of the muezzin, he sent for him. When
            Jaʿfar appeared, the Sultan said: "Why did <pb n="755" ed="kopf"/> you send me a message
            yesterday saying that you were going to die? What is the matter with you?" Said the
            muezzin: "It would have been so but for my lord's servant, the physician Abū Hulaiqa,
            who gave me a theriac which cured me immediately. On the same day, a man crouched down
            to urinate when a viper bit his penis, killing him. On hearing of the incident, the
            Sultan pitied the man, for he was very compassionate to the people. He went to the Cairo
            citadel, stayed there overnight and got up early in the morning. Meanwhile Rashīd al-Dīn
            who had come to report for duty, was sitting in a circle of people near the palace gate,
            since the Sultan was away. He waited until the Sultan called out to him. "What is that
            theriac," asked the Sultan, "which you have prepared and which has become so famous
            among the people for its wonderful effect. You have never told me about it." Rashīd
            al-Dīn replied: "O my lord, your servant does nothing except for my lord. The reason for
            your servant's failing to inform my lord about it was your servant's desire to try it
            out; for it was he who invented it, and he wished to be sure that it was effective
            before bringing it to my lord's notice. Since my lord is already aware of its
            effectiveness, the purpose has been achieved.'' Said the Sultan: Fetch me as much as you
            have at your disposal. He left a servant sitting at the gate who was to wait for Rashīd
            al-Dīn's return, while he himself went back to his house, as if he had not gone up to
            the citadel that night, but had started out at that hour, only for this purpose. On
            returning home, Rashīd al-Dīn found only a small quantity of theriac, for the people,
            anxious to acquire it, had almost exhausted the stock. So he went to those of his
            colleagues to whom he had given some, and from them collected a quantity of eleven
            dirhams. Promising his colleagues that he would give them in return the theriac many
            times over, he put it in a small silver vessel, on which he wrote the indications and
            dosages, and took it to the waiting servant. The latter delivered it to the Sultan, <pb
              n="756" ed="kopf"/> who always kept it with him; and whenever his teeth ached, he
            rubbed them with the theriac and felt instant relief, as mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Another story about him and the Sultan: One of the Sultan's women was suffering from a
            disease which the physicians were unable to cure. She sent a message to Rashīd al-Dīn,
            saying: "I am sure that if the Sultan knew a better physician in Egypt, than you, he
            would not entrust himself and his children to your care, to the exclusion of all other
            physicians. It is not for lack of knowledge of your merits that you have not been called
            to cure me, but because little importance is attached to my person. The proof of your
            excellence is that when you are taken ill you cure yourself within a few days; likewise,
            when one of your children ails, you make him well within a day or two. The same is true
            of the other women here; you treat all of them, and your cure is always effective after
            a short time." Rashīd al-Dīn replied: "Not all diseases respond to treatment; if they
            did, no one would die." But she dismissed this objection, saying: "I realize that there
            is no physician in Egypt who can cure me. So I am going to advise the Sultan to call in
            some physicians from Damascus for me." The Sultan engaged two Christian physicians. When
            they arrived from Damascus, the Sultan was about to leave for Damiette. Asked which of
            the physicians were to accompany him and which were to stay behind, he said: "All the
            physicians will stay with that woman and attend her; only Rashīd al-Dīn will go with
            me." Since all these physicians had done their best to cure the woman and had not
            succeeded, the Sultan's decision was a convenient excuse for Rashīd al-Dīn. He quoted
            what Hippocrates had said in his "Prognostics."</p>
          <p>So Rashīd al-Dīn accompanied the Sultan on his journey, and one month passed without
            his services being required. Then, in Damiette, the Sultan sent for him one night, and
            when he arrived <pb n="757" ed="kopf"/> he found his patient feverish, displaying
            various inconsistent symptoms. He prepared a potion adapted to the different symptoms,
            took it to him at dawn, and before the sun had set, all his complaints had vanished.
            This made a very deep impression upon the Sultan, and he continued to take that potion
            until he arrived in Alexandria.</p>
          <p>Once, on the first day of the fast of Ramadan, in Alexandria, Rashīd al-Dīn fell sick.
            The physicians on duty came to consult him about what to give the Sultan for his
            fastbreaking meal, and he said: "There is a potion which he has tried out and which he
            praises and always asks for. As long as he does not complain about anything new, which
            would preclude the use of that potion, give it to him, but if you observe any new
            symptom, apply whatever the circumstances require." The.physicians disregarded his
            advice, determined to change the Sultan's diet on their own initiative. When they had
            done so, the Sultan's temper became disturbed. He called the physicians and asked for
            Rashīd al-Dīn's formula, and then questioned them about it. The formula included seeds
            of wild chicory, which the physicians had left out. The Sultan said: "Why did you omit
            those seeds, which strengthen the liver, clean the blood vessels and prevent thirst?"
            One of the physicians replied: "By Allāh, your servants are not to be blamed for their
            omission. Al-Asʿad b. Abī 'l-Ḥasan reported a queer tradition implying that the seeds of
            wild chicory harm the spleen — I myself know nothing about it -and claimed that our lord
            was suffering from splenitis, and your servants acted according to his advice." Said the
            Sultan: "By Allāh, he is a liar. I have no pain in my spleen." He gave orders to restore
            the wild chicory seeds and then questioned the physicians about the usefulness of each
            of the other ingredients that they had left out. They were made to restore them, and the
            Sultan resumed bis habit of taking the potion, finding it always beneficial and
            praiseworthy.  <pb n="758" ed="kopf"/></p>
          <p>Another story about Rashīd al-Dīn. One day, the Sultan asked him to prepare for him a
            sauce to be eaten with yakhnf [a kind of ragout] on journeys. The Sultan suggested that
            it strengthens the stomach, stimulates appetite and softens the stools. Rashīd al-Dīn
            thereupon prepared a sauce according to the following recipe: Take one part of parsley
            and half a part of both Ocumum basilicum and the pith of a juicy citron which has been
            steeped for some days in salt water and thereafter in fresh water, pound each of them
            separately in a stone mortar until it becomes like an ointment, mix the whole in the
            mortar, squeeze out some selected green lemons over it and pour as much salt on it as is
            necessary for seasoning. Then fill it into small pots, each holding the amount to be
            served at one time (fill the container quite full, for otherwise the contents will get
            musty): smear the containers with good olive oil and store them away. When the Sultan
            partook of the sauce, it pro-duced the desired effect and he praised it greatly.</p>
          <p>On leaving for the country of the Byzantines, the Sultan asked Rashīd al-Dīn: "Will
            this sauce keep for a long time?" "No," said Rashid al-Dīn. Said the Sultan: "Will it
            not keep one month?" "Yes, said Rashīd al-Dīn, "if it is prepared in the way I
            indicated." Said the Sultan: "Prepare as much of it every month, as will suffice me
            during that month and send it to me at the new moon." Rashīd al-Dīn complied with this
            request. The Sultan never failed to use it when traveling and praised it loudly. </p>
          <p>Here is an anecdote about Rāshid al-Dīn. A countrywoman came to him with her son, a
            sickly, emaciated youth. Describing her son's condition, she said that although she had
            labored hard to cure him he, was getting steadily weaker and leaner. She had come to
            Rashīd al-Dīn in the morning, before he rode out, and the air was cool. He looked at the
            youth, inspected him closely, felt his pulse and, while doing so, called out to his
            servant: "Bring me my gown [farajīyya]; <pb n="759" ed="kopf"/> I want to put it on."
            When he spoke these words, the pulse of the youth quickened, and his color also changed.
            So the physician guessed that he was in love. When he felt his pulse a little later, it
            had calmed down. But when the servant appeared and said: "Here is the gown," he felt the
            pulse of the youth once more and noticed that is had quickened again. Then he said to
            the youth's mother: "Your son is in love, and the one he loves is called Farajīyya." The
            mother replied: "Yes, indeed, O my lord, he is in love with a girl by that name, and I
            am sick of reproaching him on her account." She was greatly astonished that he had found
            out the girl's name without any previous knowledge of the matter.</p>
          <p>The author says: A similar incident is reported to Galen with regard to a woman in
            love. He was once called to a lady of high standing who had been ill for a long time.
            Surmising that she was in love, he paid frequent visits to her. One day troops on
            horseback were carrying out exercises on the drilling ground. Galen was feeling the
            pulse of the patient when one of those present reported on that event, noting that a
            certain soldier particularly distinguished himself by good horsemanship and excellent
            drill. When the woman heard that soldier's name, her pulse quickened, whereas when the
            physician felt it a little later, he noticed that it had resumed its former rate. Then
            Galen secretly requested that man to repeat his report, and when he did so and Galen
            again found that the woman's pulse quickened he became convinced that she was in love
            with that soldier. This incident points to profound knowledge and great
            perspicacity.</p>
          <p>I say: All the members of Rashīd al-Dīn Abū Hulaiqa's family are best known in Egypt
            and Syria by the name of Banū Shākir, since the physician Abū Shākir was very famous.
            Those related to him became known as Banū Shākir even if they were not his sons.</p>
          <p>When I met Rashīd al-Dīn Abū Hulaiqa, he had already heard that the famous physicians
            in his family were mentioned and their <pb n="760" ed="kopf"/> learning and achievements
            described by me. He thanked me and was most kind. I thereupon recited to him the
            following impromptu poem:</p>
          <quote><p><l>How shall I not praise those whose merits</l><l> Are known in both East and
                West?</l><l> There shine on their account, in the sky of nobility,</l><l> Stars of
                good luck that never set.</l><l> They are men whose rank in learning among the
                people </l><l> You see transcending the high station of the planets. </l><l> How
                many books on medicine they have written, containing </l><l> Everything that arouses
                wonder and admiration. </l><l> My praise to the Banū Shākir has not ceased, whether
                far or near.</l><l> I perpetuate their generosity by writing these glowing
                lines.</l></p></quote>
          <p>As to why a ring was attached to al-Rashīd's ear, from which he received his sobriquet,
            it was as follows: None of the sons of his father survived but he. When his mother was
            pregnant with him, his father was advised to prepare a silver ring, the value of which
            he was to give as alms; and at the very hour the child was born, he was to have a
            jeweler in attendence who was to pierce the infant's ear and fasten the ring to it. He
            did so, and Allāh vouchsafed the child to live. His mother enjoined him never to remove
            the ring, and so it remained. When the boy married, he had several male children.
            Fearing they might die, as had been the case in his own generation, he remembered the
            matter of the ring and had one made for his eldest son, Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Abū Saʿīd,
            whom he named after his paternal uncle.</p>
          <p>Here is one of the poems composed by Rashīd al-Dīn Abū Hulaiqa; he recited it to me:
              <pb n="761" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <quote><p><l>The beloved one has agreed to a rendez-vous on a night</l><l> When the
                watcher was negligent and fell asleep</l><l> In a meadow which, but for its
                transience, could have been compared</l><l> To the Garden of Eden with all its
                attributes. </l><l> My companion is like the shining moon. </l><l> My senses reeled
                within me.</l></p></quote>
          <p>[Another poem of his is then quoted. ]</p>
          <p>Here is yet another of Rashīd al-Dīn's poems:</p>
          <quote><p><l>O my two companions, I find no sleep </l><l> Because I am in love; my heart
                is captured and chained </l><l> By love for a girl whose face outshines the full
                moon, </l><l> Especially through its contrast with her black hair. </l><l> I am
                confused by her, who equals the new moon in beauty, </l><l> How strange it is that
                the moon should lead astray instead of guiding!</l><l> She has teeth like a string
                of pearls,</l><l> And her speech is like pearls when scattered.</l></p></quote>
          <p>The following lines he composed in Damiette after receiving a letter from his father in
            Cairo, informing him of the latter's recovery from an illness:</p>
          <quote><p><l>The clouds of grace pour their rain upon me </l><l> Since the affliction you
                suffered from has ceased. </l><l> I am enveloped in delight since I have seen your
                writing. </l><l> How can I discharge my duty of thanksgiving?</l></p></quote>
          <p>Rashīd al-Dīn Abū Hulaiqa wrote the following works: </p>
          <list>
            <item n="1"> A treatise on the preservation of health. </item>
            <item n="2"> A treatise explaining that spiritual enjoyment is more pleasurable than
              physical enjoyment; since the former is supplementary [to the <pb n="762" ed="kopf"/>
              satisfaction of physical needs] while physical enjoyment is merely the result of the
              absence of pain, and if it exceeds a certain limit, it again causes pain.</item>
            <item n="3"> A book on simple drugs he entitled "A Selection of One Thousand Drugs"; on

              the merits of which have been demonstrated by experience and which, when applied to a
              curable disease, have always proved effective. He collected his material from medical
              books written from the time of Adam to our time, arranging it carefully.</item>
            <item n="4"> A treatise on the inevitability of death. The argument advanced in this

              heat and the heat of the outside air, it is eventually destroyed by these two factors,
              after mentioning these, he quotes the following lines:</item>

          <quote><p><l>Either of the two is fatal to me,</l><l> How much more both of them

          <p> a son of Abū Hulaiqa, the peerless scholar and most perfect of savants, was born in
            Cairo in the year 620/1223. He was named Muḥammad when he embraced Islam in the days of
            al-Malik al-Zāhir Rukn al-Dīn Baibars al-Maliki ai-Sālihi. Endowed by Allāh with the
            most perfect intellect, exquisite manners, supreme acumen and vast knowledge, he
            mastered the medical art and acquainted himself with the philosophical sciences. He was
            incomparable in everything he undertook, and no one else possessed the excellent
            qualities which were combined in him. He <pb n="763" ed="kopf"/> was soft-spoken and
            very generous, doing good for friends and relatives, both close and distant.</p>
          <p>In the month of Shawwāl of the year 667/1270, when he was in al-Mansūr al-Zāhiri's
            camp, I received a letter from him, which revealed his utmost refinement, wide
            knowledge, penetrating insight, great affection and abundant goodwill. In that letter he
            informed me that he had found in Cairo, a copy of the book which I had written on the
            classes of physicians and that he had bought it and incorporated it in his library. He
            spoke of the book in glowing terms, which shows his generous character and noble
            disposition. The letter opened with these lines:</p>
          <quote><p><l>I am a man who loves you for your notable achievements,</l><l> Of which I
                have heard, the ear being able to love no less than the eye.</l></p></quote>
          <p>I answered him in writing, with a poem which I composed in the same meter and
            rhyme:</p>
          <quote><p><l>Your letter has reached me, beautifully written </l><l> And filled with
                thoughts which shine like the sun, </l><l> The letter of a man noble, generous and
                praiseworthy, </l><l> With a benign countenance, which radicates light. </l><l> He
                is the lord and master through whom East and West flourish in wisdom, </l><l> A
                savant encompassing all the sciences, </l><l> To whom no gate of noble action is
                closed,</l><l> A generous man, accumulating all kinds of accomplishments,</l><l> But
                scattering his money with an open hand.</l><l> When his qualities are mentioned at
                gatherings,</l><l> They fill the air as with the odor of musk.</l><l> He is first in
                the race for lofty goals,</l><l> And he who aspires to reach him is bound to fail. 
                  <pb n="764" ed="kopf"/></l><l> When speaking, he outshines all others with his
                rhetoric. </l><l> And even a priest falls silent while he talks. </l><l> If Galen
                had lived in his time,</l><l> He would surely have said: this one can be trusted in
                medicine. </l><l> There is no one like him in preserving health </l><l> And no one
                as able as he in observing disease. </l><l> If I praise the merits of Muḥammad,
                </l><l> Everyone will confirm my words. </l><l> But if I tried to enumerate his
                achievements, </l><l> I would fail though I were as eloquent as al-Farazdaq. </l><l>
                No wonder that, with regard to the sons of Hulaiqa, </l><l> I am bound by the ties
                of true friendship. </l><l> To their father I am obliged for many favors of long
                ago. </l><l> So my gratitude is due to them for ever — </l><l> To them, who all
                aspire to lofty aims, but especially </l><l> To him who said to me, while
                experiencing a great longing: </l><l> "I am a man who loves you for your notable
                achievements. </l><l> Of which I have heard, the ear being able to love as less then
                the eye."</l><l> May they continue to enjoy well-being and never-failing health,
                </l><l> As long as the great and lofty trees put forth leaves.</l></p></quote>
          <p>Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Saʿīd never ceased to study and to behave commandably in both word
            and deed. He studied medicine under his father, mastering its general and specific
            aspects and familiarizing himself with both its theory and practice. He served as
            physician to the Sultan al-Malik al-Zāhir Baibars al-Maliki al-Sālihī, who held him in
            high esteem and bestowed on him great favors, an honorable position and lavish
            gifts.</p>
          <p>Muhadhdhab al-Dīn had two brothers, one of whom was Muwaffaq al-Dīn Abū 'l-Khair, who
            distinguished himself in ophthalmology and <pb n="765" ed="kopf"/> was a man of great
            scholarship. Before reaching his twentieth year, he wrote a book on eye treatment for
            al-Malik al-Sālih Najm al-Dīn. The younger brother, ʿAlam al-Dīn Abū Nasr was extremely
            gifted. He ranked among the savants and distinguished himself in medicine. He had wide
            knowledge and a powerful intellect.</p>

          <p> The great savant and scholar, Abū Saʿīd b. Muwaffaq al-Dīn Yaʿqub, was a Christian
            from Jerusalem. He distinguished himself in medicine, being an expert in both its theory
            and practice. He had a keen intellect, an eloquent tongue and excellent diction. He
            studied Arabic philology under our teacher Taqī al-Dīn Hazʿal b. ʿAskar b. Halīl, who
            had no rival in his time in the science of grammar. Later, Rashīd al-Dīn Abū Saʿīd
            studied medicine under my paternal uncle, Rashīd al-Dīn ʿAlī b. Khalīfa, when the latter
            was in the service of the Sultan al-Malik al-Muʿazzam.</p>

          <p>Among my uncle's disciples, there was none like Abū Saʿīd; for he kept close company
            with his teacher, never leaving him either at home or on journeys. He stayed in Damascus
            with him, applying himself assiduously to his studies until he was thoroughly acquainted
            with all the books which are indispensable for learning the principles of the medical
            art. He then studied under his guidance a great many books by Galen and others,
            penetrating their meaning as deeply as is possible. He also studied under our teacher
            Muhadhdhab al-Dīn 1Abd al-Raḥmān ʿAlī. In the year 632/1234 he was appointed to the
            service of al-Malik al-Kāmil, with a monthly salary, and held this appointment for a
            time, residing in Cairo. Later he entered the service of al-Malik al-Sālih Najm al-Dīn
            Ayyūb, the son of al-Malik al-Kāmil, with whom he stayed for about nine years. <pb
              n="766" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>While in Damascus, al-Malik al-Sālih Najm al-Dīn developed a gangrenous sore in the
            thigh, and the physician Rashīd al-Dīn Abū Hulaiqa began to treat him. After the illness
            had persisted a long time, the Sultan summoned Abū Saʿīd and complained to him of his
            condition. There was rivalry and strife between Rashīd alDīn Abū Hulaiqa and Rashīd
            al-Dīn Abū Saʿīd. When Abū Saʿīd maintained that Abū Hulaiqa's treatment was not the
            correct one, al-Malik al-Sālih threw an angry look at Abū Hulaiqa. Thereupon the latter
            stood up, went out and sat down at the gate of the Sultan's residence, while Abū Saʿīd
            stayed behind, intending to take up the treatment. Abū Saʿīd, in the presence of the
            Sultan, was stricken with hemiplegia and fell to the ground. The Sultan gave orders to
            carry him to his house, where he remained in that condition for four days and then died.
            His death occurred in Damascus in the last decade of the month of Ramadān in the year
            646/ 1248.</p>
          <p>Al-Malik al-Sālih returned to Egypt, and his illness became aggravated. He remained
            thus until he died, may Allāh have mercy upon him. He passed away on Monday, the 15th
            day of Shaʿbān in the year 647/1249, after possessing enormous prestige and great power.
            When death came to him, when the destroyer of pleasures alighted at his house, he
            vanished as if he had never been. This is how fate deals with man, as I said in a
            poem:</p>
          <quote><p><l>Beware of fate as much as thou canst,</l><l> For it will strike even the

                The lord of mankind and ruler of kingdoms,</l><l> Enjoyed good health until a
                disease afflicted him</l><l> And no device was of any avail.</l><l> Prospering in

            acquainted himself with the philosophical disciplines; he was also an authority on
            religious law. He studied medicine in Egypt under Abū Zakarīyyā Yaḥyā al-Bayyāsā and
            served al-Malik al-Masʿūd Aqsīs, the son of al-Malik al-Kāmil, with whom he stayed in
            Yemen for a time. He enjoyed high esteem and very gracious treatment on his part, and
            received a salary fixed by him of one hundred Egyptian dinars per month. He remained in
            the service of al-Malik al-Masʿūd until the latter died, may Allāh have mercy upon him.
            Then al-Malik al-Kāmil bestowed upon him some fiefs in Egypt, the revenues of which he
            received annually, and ordered him to be included in his retinue.</p>

          <p>I first met him in Damascus at the beginning of the month of Rajab in the year
            630/1232. He was a handsome old man with fine <pb n="768" ed="kopf"/> gray hair, of
            perfect build, dark-complexioned, soft-spoken and endowed with great virtues. I met him
            again in Cairo, where he received me kindly and hospitably. He had been a friend of my
            father's for many years.</p>
          <p>Asʿad al-Dīn died in Cairo in the year 635/1237. He wrote a book entitled "Witty
            Sayings of Keen Minds Engaged in the Criticism of Physicians"; it was written for
            al-Malik al-Kāmil Muḥammad b. Abī Bakr b. Ayyūb.</p>
          <p>Diyā' al-Dīn b. al-Baitār, i.e., the illustrious savant and scholar Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd
            Allāh b. Amad al-Māligīs the botanist, known as Ibn al-Baitār, was the greatest
            authority of his age on plants, their identification, medicinal use, places of
            occurrence, and taxonomic names. He traveled to the land of the Greeks and the remotest
            parts of Asia Minor, where he encountered people engaged in botany. From them he derived
            the knowledge of many plants, which he observed in their natural habitats. In the
            Maghrib and elsewhere, he likewise came in contact with many outstanding botanists and
            again had the opportunity of observing and studying new plants. He knew Dioscurides'
            book so well that almost no one could compete with him in this respect. I found in him
            such an astonishing degree of knowledge and understanding of plants and of what
            Dioscurides and Galen had said about them.</p>
          <p>I first met him in Damascus in the year 633/1235 and was able to observe his
            extraordinary sociability, perfect integrity, noble bearing, excellent character and
            magnanimity. In his company I inspected many plants in their habitats on the outskirts
            of Damascus. I also studied with him his commentary on the names of drugs occurring in
            the book of Dioscurides and was able to perceive his vast erudition and profound
            understanding. For the purpose of my studies with him, I had procured a number of books
            on simple drugs, such as those of <pb n="769" ed="kopf"/> Dioscorides, Galen and
            Ghāfiqī, in addition to other, similarly important works on the subject. In his
            commentary, Ibn al-Baitār first mentions — according to what he had been able to verify
            in the country of the Byzantines — the Greek names used by Dioscorides in his book. He
            then notes briefly what Dioscorides had said regarding the makeup, properties and
            effects of the drugs, and also what Galen had written about their characterization,
            "temper," effects, etc. Moreover, he adduces some sayings of later authors, their
            differences of opinion and instances of error and ambiguity found with some of them in
            the description of the drugs. Together with Ibn Baitār, I constantly referred to the
            books I had procured, and found that he did not deviate in any respect from what they
            contained. Still more astounding, whenever he mentioned any drug, he always indicated in
            which chapter of the books by Dioscorides and Galen it was to be found, and even under
            which item it appeared among all the drugs mentioned in that chapter.</p>
          <p>Ibn al-Baitār was in the service of al-Malik al-Kāmil Muḥammad b. Abī Bakr b. Ayyūb,
            who relied upon him with regard to simple drugs and herbs and appointed him chief of all
            herbalists and horticulturālists in Egypt. He remained in al-Malik al-Kāmil's service
            until the latter died in Damascus, may Allāh have mercy upon him.</p>
          <p>Then he went to Cairo and entered the service of al-Malik al-Sālih Najm al-Dīn Ayyūb,
            the son of al-Malik al-Kāmil. He stood high in his favor and enjoyed great prestige
            during his reign. Diya' al-Dīn [Ibn al-Baitār], the herbalist died suddenly in Damascus
            in the month of Shaʿbān of the year 646/1248, may Allāh have mercy upon him. </p>
          <p>Diyā al-Dīn b. al-Baitār wrote the following works:</p>

          <p><ref target="#FN20" type="noteAnchor">20</ref> Abū Nasr Muḥammad b. Muḥammad b. Uzalagh
            b. Tarkhān was a native of Fārāb, a town in a Turkish district of Khurāsān. His father
            was an army officer. He was of Persian origin, lived in Baghdād for a time and then
            moved to Damascus, where he stayed for the rest of his life — may Allāh have mercy upon
            him. He was an accomplished philosopher and learned imām, who had mastered the
            philosophical disciplines and excelled in mathematics. He had a pure soul and a keen
            intellect, abstained from worldly pleasures and contented himself with what provided for
            his needs, leading the life of an ancient philosopher. He had a strong inclination for
            medicine and was acquainted with its general aspects, but he did not practice it;
            neither did he attempt to specialize.</p>
          <p>Saif al-Dīn Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. Abī al-Āmidī told me that al-Fārābī had at first been
            a watchman in an orchard in Damascus, but that despite this occupation, he had
            constantly applied himself to philosophy and to the thoughts of the ancients and the
            interpretation of their meaning. He was so poor that when staying up at night in order
            to read and write, he used his watchman's lamp as a light. He remained in this condition
            for some time. Then his affairs took a rapid turn for the better: his learning became
            known, his writings won fame, he acquired many pupils and became the greatest authority
              <pb n="772" ed="kopf"/> of his age. The Emir Saif al-Dawlah Abū 'l-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. ʿAbd
            Allāh b. Hamdān al-Taghlibī invited him to his court, honored him greatly, granted him a
            prominent position and revered him.</p>
          <p>I have copied the following from the hand of one of my teachers: "Abū Nasr al-Fārābī
            traveled to Egypt in the year 338/949 under the caliphate of al-Radiyy, while staying
            with Saif al-Dawlah ʿAlī b. Hamdān. Saif al-Dawlah recited the prayer for him in the
            presence of fifteen men of his closest entourage.</p>
          <p>It is reported that of all the presents offered him by Saif al-Dawlah he accepted only
            four silver dirhams daily, which he spent on the bare necessities of life. He attached
            no importance to elegant appearance, a grand residence or the acquisition of
            property.</p>
          <p>It is affirmed that he subsisted exclusively on the cardiac fluid of young lambs and
            seasoned wine. There is a report that at the beginning of his career he was a judge, but
            that when he became aware of the existence of scientific knowledge, he renounced his
            occupation and devoted himself wholeheartedly to science. He felt no inclination for any
            worldly pursuit. It is said that he would leave his house at night, and go to the
            watchmen to read by the light of their lamps. In music he reached an unsurpassable
            standard in both theoretical knowledge and practical skill. It is reported that he
            devised a marvelous instrument with which he produced wonderful soul-stirring
            melodies.</p>
          <p>According to one report, he was induced to study philosophy by the fact that a man
            deposited with him some of Aristotle's works, which, upon inspection, he found to his
            liking, so that he felt impelled to study them. He did not desist until he understood
            them thoroughly and became a full-fledged philosopher.</p>
          <p>From a work of Abū Nasr al-Fārābī, I have copied the following statement on the meaning
            of the word "philosophy": "Philosophy" is a <pb n="773" ed="kopf"/> Greek word which has
            entered Arabic. Its Greek form is "philosophia," and it means "love of wisdom," being
            composed of "philo" and "sophia"; the first word means "love" and the second "wisdom,"
            "Philosopher" comes from "philosophy"; in Greek it is "philosophos" — many derivatives
            are formed in that language in this way — and it means "lover of wisdom." According to
            the conception of the Greeks, a "lover of wisdom" is one who makes wisdom the purpose of
            his life.</p>
          <p>Concerning the spread of philosophy, Abū Nasr al-Fārābī made the following statement:
            "In the days of the Greek kings and after the death of Aristotle, philosophy spread in
            Alexandria until the last days of the 'woman' [Cleopatra]. When Aristotle died, the
            teaching of philosophy made no progress in Alexandria until the time of the thirteen
            kings, under whose reign twelve teachers of philosophy arose in succession; one of them
            was Andronicus. The last of these kings was the 'woman.' Augustus, the king of the
            Romans, vanquished and killed her and usurped her kingdom. When his rule had become
            firmly established, he inspected the libraries and supervised the output of books and
            found that they housed copies of the works of Aristotle, which had been written in the
            days of the author and at the time of Theophrastus. He also found that the teachers and
            philosophers had written books on the same subjects as Aristotle. He gave orders to copy
            those works which had been copied in the days of Aristotle and his disciples and to make
            them the basis of teaching while discarding the others. Placing Andronicus in charge of
            that scheme, he ordered him to make copies which he would take to Rome with him and
            others which he would leave at the Academy of Alexandria. He also ordered him to appoint
            a successor, who would take up teaching in Alexandria in his stead, and to come with him
            to Rome. From then on, philosophy was taught in two places. This state of affairs
            continued until the rise of Christianity, when the <pb n="774" ed="kopf"/> teaching of
            philosophy was discontinued in Rome, whereas it continued in Alexandria until the king
            of the Christians raised the matter for discussion. The bishops assembled and considered
            what to maintain of that teaching and what to abolish. The arrived at the conclusion
            that everything should be taught from the books of logic to the last book of physics
            while everything coming after that should not be taught since they regarded it as a
            danger to Christianity, whereas what they permitted to be taught they regarded as a
            means to fortify their faith. From then on, all that could be taught openly of
            philosophy was the aforesaid while the remainder had to be studied clandestinely, until
            the rise of Islam long afterwards. Then the teaching of philosophy was transferred from
            Alexandria to Antioch, where it proceeded for a long time, until only one teacher
            remained. This man taught two men, who left the city, taking the books with them. One of
            these two was a native of Harrān and the other a native of Marw. The latter instructed
            two men, one of whom was Ibrāhīm al-Marwazī and the other Yuḥanna b. Hilān, while the
            Harrānian's disciples were Isrāʿīl the bishop and Quwairī, who both went to Baghdad.
            Isrāʿīl applied himself to religion, whereas Quwairī engaged in teaching philosophy. As
            to Yūḥanna b. Hīlān, he, too, devoted himself to religion. Ibrāhīm al-Marwazī went to
            Baghdād and settled there. His disciple was Mattā b. Yunān. What was studied of
            philosophy at that time extended to the end of existing things."</p>
          <p>Abū Nasr al-Fārābī says that he studied philosophy under Yuḥannā b. Hīlān up to the end
            of the "Book'of Syllogistic Demonstration." That part of philosophy which was not
            studied under Christian domination was called "what comes after the existing things"
            [metaphysics]. Later, when philosophy was the concern of Muslim scholars, metaphysics
            was studied: it became the habit of people to study philosophy, from physics onwards, to
            the limit of what a man was <pb n="775" ed="kopf"/> able to master. This is why Abū Nasr
            says that he went on to the end of the "Book of Syllogistic Demonstration."</p>
          <p>My paternal uncle, Rashīd al-Dīn Abū-al-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. Khalīfa, told me that al-Fārābī
            died while staying with Saif al-Dawlah b. Hamdān in the month of Rajab of the year
            339/950. He had studied science under Yuḥannā b. Hīlān in Baghdād in the days of
            al-Muqtadir. A contemporary of his was Abū-al-Bishr Mattā b. Yūnān. He was older than
            Abū Nasr, but Abū Nasr was cleverer and more eloquent. Abū-al-Bishr Mattā studied under
            Ibrāhīm al-Marwazī. He died during the caliphate of al-Rādī, between the years 323/934
            and 329/939. Yuḥannā b. Hīlān and Ibrāhīm al-Marwazī had both studied under a man from
            Marw.</p>
          <p>In his "Annotations" Shaykh Abū Sulaymān Muḥammad b. Tāhis b. Bahrām al-Sijistānī, says
            that according to what he heard from Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī, Mattā had studied the "Isagoge" with
            a Christian and the "Categories" and"Hermeneutics" with a man named Rūbīl. The "Book of
            Analogy" he had studied under Abū Yaḥyā al-Marwazī. </p>
          <p>Qādī Saʿīd b. Aḥmad b. Saʿīd, in his "Book of Information on the Classes of Nations,"
            says that al-Fārābī studied logic under Yuḥannā b. Hīlān, who died in Baghdād in the
            days of al-Muqtadir. He surpassed all Muslim scholars in that art, in the probing of its
            depths, the elucidation of its obscurities, the exploration of its secrets and his ready
            understanding of it. He assembled the essentials of that art in books, accurately and
            lucidly written, pointing out what al-Kindī and others had neglected to analyze and
            elucidate and clearly setting forth the five methods of logic, describing the modes of
            their application and the use of analogy with regard to each of them. So his books on
            that subject turned out to be highly satisfactory and extremely erudite. In addition, he
            wrote an excellent and original book entitled "An Enumeration of the Sciences and a
            Definition of their Aims." Students of all sciences must have recourse to it and study
            it right from the start. He also wrote a book on the <pb n="776" ed="kopf"/> aims of
            Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy, which testifies to his proficiency in philosophy
            and his accurate knowledge of the various scientific disciplines. It is the best guide
            to the speculative method and to procedures of investigations. He reveals in it the
            secrets and achievements of the sciences, one by one, and explains how to proceed,
            gradually, from one to another. He starts with the philosophy of Plato, explains the aim
            which Plato pursued by it and enumerates his writings in this field. He then goes on to
            the philosophy of Aristotle, introducing it with remarkable discourse, in which he. sets
            forth how he himself gradually comprehended Aristotle's philosophy. Then he describes
            the aims pursued by Aristotle in his writings on logic and physics, book by book, until,
            according to the copy at my disposal, he winds up with the beginning of metaphysics and
            the method of deriving proofs on it from physics. I know of no work more useful to the
            student of philosophy, for it explains the concepts common to all sciences and those
            specific to each of them. Only through that book can we understand the concepts of the
            categories and the premises underlying the various sciences.</p>
          <p>In addition al-Farabī wrote two books on metaphysics and political science, the one
            entitled "al-Siyāsa al-Madanīya" [State Policy], the other "al-Sira al-Fādila"[al-Madīna
            al-Fādila = the virtuous state]. In these two works, he expounds, by the method of
            Aristotle, important parts of metaphysics concerning the six spiritual elements, the
            manner in which the bodily substances are derived from these elements, the arrangement
            of the elements and their links with natural philosophy. He also discusses in these
            works the categories of man and his psychical forces, distinguishes between revelation
            and philosophy and describes the various kinds of virtuous and non-virtuous states and
            the need of every state for royal guidance and prophetic laws. <pb n="777" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>I say: According to the historians, al-Fārāhī would meet Abū Bakr b. al-Sarrāj and
            learn grammar from him, while Ibn al-Sarrāj learnt logic from him. Al-Fārābī also
            composed poetry. When Abū Nasr was asked: "Whom do you regard as the greater scholar,
            yourself or Aristotle?", he replied: "If I had lived in his time, I should have been the
            foremost of his disciples." He is also reported to have said: "I have read Aristotle's
            'Music' forty times, but I still feel the need to study it."</p>
          <p>Here is a prayer composed by Abū Nasr al-Fārābī: O God, I pray you, whose existence is
            unconditional, the cause of all causes, who have been here from the very beginning and
            who will never cease to exist, that you preserve me from sinfulness, and make me place
            my hope in such works as will find favor with you. O God, bestow on me all virtues and
            grant me success in my affairs; make my endeavors and all my undertakings prosper, O God
            of the East and of the West, Lord of the Seven Stars . . . . . . . . . . . O God, clothe
            me in the garb of splendor and let me share the miracles of the prophets, the happiness
            of the rich, the wisdom of the savants and the humility of the God-fearing. O God, save
            me from the world of misery and perdition and make me one of the sincere and true, who
            will dwell in heaven with the righteous and the martyrs. You are God besides whom there
            is no other god, the cause of all things and the light of earth and heaven; grant me an
            emanation of the acting intellect. O Lord of Majesty and Favors, purify my soul with the
            light of wisdom and allot me the faculty of gratitude for all you have bestowed upon me.
            Make me see truth as it is and inspire me with the desire to follow it; make me see
            falsehood as it is and preserve me from believing and heeding it. Purge my soul from the
            slags of primeval matter. You are the first cause.</p>

          <head><persName>ʿĪsā al-Raqqī,</persName></head>
          <p> known as al-Tiflisī, was a famous physician in his day. He possessed a thorough
            knowledge of the medical art and achieved marvelous cures. He was in the service of Saif
            al-Dawlah Ibn Hamdān. ʿUbayd Allāh b. Jibrā'īl said: "A person I trust told me: "When
            Saif al-Dawlah was taking his meals, twenty-four physicians were seated at his table,
            some of whom received a double salary because they occupied themselves with two
            sciences, and some received a triple salary because they occupied themselves with three
            sciences. Among them was cIsā al-Raqqī, who became known as al-Tiflisī. He was pious and
            wrote books on the Shiʿite creed [the Hamdānid dynasty was Shiʿite] and other subjects.
            He also translated from Syriac into Arabic. He received four salaries, one for his
            medical work, one as a translator and two for two other sciences."</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head><persName>Al-Yabrūdī,</persName></head>
          <p> i.e., Abū 'l-Faraj Jūrjis b. Yūḥanna b. Sahl b. Ibrāhīm, a Jacobite Christian,
            excelled in the medical art, being well-versed both in its theoretical foundations and
            in its practical application. He was reckoned one of the most distinguished
            representatives of that art. He was very active and ardently fond of studying.</p>
          <p>Sharat al-Dīn b. ʿUnayn, may Allāh have mercy upon him, told me: Al-Yabrūdī never
            ceased working and was indefatigable. He was never seen without a book in front of
            him."</p>
          <p>A Christian, al-Sanī al-Baʿlbakkī the physician, told me in Damascus: "Al-Yabrūdī was
            born and spent the first years of his life in Yabrūd, a large village near Saidanāyā,
            where many Christians live. In this village, al-Yabrūdī, like the other Christian <pb
              n="784" ed="kopf"/> inhabitants, engaged in agriculture and other farmwork. He also
            collected wormwood in that part of the Damascus district which was nearest to his
            village, and took on the back of an animal to Damascus, where he sold it to people who
            burnt it in baker's ovens and elsewhere. Once, on passing through the Tuma Gate in
            Damascus with a load of wormwood, he saw a man whose nose was bleeding profusely being
            bled by an aged physician on the side of his body opposite the place from which the
            blood was flowing. He stopped and looked at the physician and, after a while, asked him:
            ' Why do you bleed this man, when more blood is flowing from his nose than should be
            extracted by venesection?' The physician said that he was doing so in order that the
            man's nose might cease to bleed, since he was drawing the blood to the side opposite the
            place from which it was flowing. The youngster retorted: Where I come from, when we wish
            to divert water from a flowing river, we dig a bed in a different direction, but not
            opposite the stream, whereupon the water stops flowing in the old bed and passes to the
            new one. This being so, why don't you bleed from the other side?' The physician did so,
            and the man's nose stopped bleeding. Seeing from al-Yabrūdī's remark that he had a good
            sense of observation, the physician said: 'If you apply yourself to the medical art, you
            will become a good physician.' Al-Yabrūdī took his words to heart and began to crave for
            knowledge. He visited that old man from time to time, and the latter instructed him on
            certain kinds of treatment. Then he left Yabrūd and the work he had been doing and took
            up quarters in Damascus in order to study medicine. He had already gained some insight
            into it, acquired the knowledge of scientific laws, undertaken the treatment of some
            patients and studied various diseases, their causes, symptoms and modes of treatment. He
            inquired who was the greatest authority of his time in medical knowledge. When told <pb
              n="785" ed="kopf"/> that in Baghdād there lived Abū 'l-Faraj b. al-Tayyib, the
            secretary of the catholicos, who was a versatile philosopher and a learned and
            experienced man in the medical art and other scientific disciplines, he equipped himself
            for the journey, took a bracelet belonging to his mother to pay for his expenses and set
            out for Baghdād. Using the bracelet to secure the necessities of life, he studied under
            Ibn al-Tayyib until he was proficient in medicine, did fine research in it and possessed
            extraordinary knowledge. He also studied logic and other philosophical disciplines.
            Thereafter he returned to Damascus and stayed there."</p>
          <p>A similar story, but transmitted through different channels is presented here in the
            name of my learned teacher, Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. ʿAlī. He said: "Muwaffaq
            al-Dīn Asʿad b. Ilyās b. al-Mitrān told me as follows: My father told me as follows: Abū
            'l-Faraj b. al-Hadīd told me as follows: Abū 'l-Karam the Physician told me as follows
            in the name of his father, Abū 'l-Ragāʿ, who had it from his grandfather: There lived in
            Damascus a bloodletter named Abū 'l-Khair, who was not numbered among the skillful. Once
            it happened that in bleeding a youg man he incised the artery. Being confused and
            stupid, he sought to stop the blood but was unable to do so. When people gathered round,
            a youth saw him and said — O my uncle, bleed him at the other arm. The physician
            accepted his advice and bled the other arm. Then the youth said — Bandage the first
            venesection. He did so, applying a plaster which he carried with him, and when the
            tightened it, the flow of blood stopped. He then closed the other venesection and the
            blood ceased altogether. The youth was presently seen driving a beast with a load of
            wormwood. The physician approached him and said: How did you know what to advise me to
            do? The youth said: At the time of watering the vineyard, I have observed that when a
            crack develops in an irrigation canal and water rushes through <pb n="786" ed="kopf"/>
            it my father is unable to stop it up unless he makes another opening, thereby
            diminishing the water streaming toward the original crack; only then is he able to
            repair that crack. The surgeon thereupon made the youth desist from selling wormwood,
            took him under his care and taught him medicine. That youth became the celebrated
            physicians and man of learning al-Yabrūdī."</p>
          <p>I say: al-Yabrudī maintained a correspondence with Ibn Ridwān in Cairo and other
            Egyptian physicians, asking them various medical questions and engaging in discussions
            of fine points with them. He copied a very great number of medical books with his own
            hand, especially the works of Galen and their commentaries and abridgments.</p>
          <p>Al-Sanī al-Baʿlbakkr further told me: "al-Yabrūdī was once walking in Jairūn Market of
            Damascus when he heard a man make a bet that he would eat several rotls of boiled
            horsemeat of the kind sold in the markets. Watching him eat more than he could take and
            then drink a quantity of beer and ice-water, whereby his condition became worse,
            al-Yabrūdī realized that he would obviously faint and be close to death unless he was
            given assistance. He followed him to his house and waited to see how his condition would
            develop. Only a very short time had passed when his family broke out into screams and
            loud weeping, thinking him already dead. Al-Yabrūdī went in and said: 'I shall cure him.
            He is not in danger.' He took him to a bathhouse nearby, forcibly opened his jaws,
            somewhat poured down his throat some boiled water with an admixture of mild emetics and
            caused him to vomit gently. He then treated him and cautiously administered drugs until
            he woke up and was restored to health. The people greatly admired him for this
            achievement. The incident became widely known and established his fame." <pb n="787"
              ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>I say: This story indicates that al-Yabrudī, in watching the behavior of that man and
            observing his condition, intended both to study his symptoms and to rescue him if he
            could manage to treat him in time. A similar story is reported by Abū Jaʿfar Aḥmad b.
            Muḥammad b. Abī 'l-Ashʿath, may Allāh have mercy upon him, in his his book "Food and
            Nutrition" he says: "One day I saw a man who had made a bet to eat a stipulated quantity
            of carrots. I went to attend his performance in order to see what would happen to him,
            not — thank God — because of any predilection on my part for keeping company with people
            of that kind, nor because I was accustomed to do so, but in order to ascertain the
            outcome of overloading the stomach with food. He took his meal on top of a wall,
            intending to show off in front of those surrounding him and to jest with them. When he
            had eaten the greater part of his supply, I observed that the masticated carrots came
            back, being a sticky pulp soaked with spittle. His eyes protruded, his breath stopped,
            his face turned red, his jugular veins and the veins of his head swelled, and then his
            lace turned ashen. He retched more than he vomited. I fancied that his breath had
            stopped because the stomach was pressing the diaphragm toward the mouth and preventing
            it from expanding for the purpose of respiration. As to the fact that he turned red and
            his jugular and other veins swelled, I fancied that this was caused by the [blood?]
            rushing to his head, as happens to a person whose arm is bandaged for bleeding and whose
            blood seeks to go in the direction in which it has been prompted to go. As to the fact
            that his face subsequently turned ashen, I fancied that the cause was the bad temper of
            his heart. If he had not vomited as much as he did, if his stomach had continued to
            press on the diaphragm in such a way as to prevent him utterly from breathing, he would
            have died of suffocation, as we have seen in <pb n="788" ed="kopf"/> the case of many
            who died from retching. As to the fact that he retched more than he vomited, I
            understood that the retching was caused by the violent disturbance of the stomach.</p>
          <p>Ibn Abū al-Ashʿath says: "It should be noted that food, when, entering the stomach in a
            great quantity, causes it to stretch and the remainder of its folds to expand, as I
            observed in the case of a beast which I dissected live in the presence of the Emir
            al-Ghadnafr. One of those present believed its stomach to be small, and so I started to
            pour water into its mouth. We poured one jar after another, until we had used a total of
            forty liters. I then looked at the lining of the stomach and found that it had stretched
            until it was of equal extension as the external surface. After I had perforated the
            stomach and the water had come out, it shrank and the folds of the interior returned to
            their former condition, as did the pylorus. We praised God, not believing our eyes."
            Shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm b. ʿAlī told me a story by the following chain of
            transmission: Muwaffaq al-Dīn Asʿad b. Ilyās the Metropolitan's son; his father; his
            maternal uncle Abū al-Faraj b. Hayān; Abū al-Karam the physician; his father; his
            grandfather. The latter said: 'One day, I was accompanying the Shaykh Abū al-Faraj
            al-Yabrūdī when a man stopped him and said, 'O Master, I was in the baths, as is my
            wont, and had my head shaved, and now I find my face all swollen and burning.' We
            examined his face and found that it was swelling and growing redder and redder. The
            physician ordered him to uncover his head and pour water on it from a pipe he had with
            him. It was in the middle of winter, and the cold was intense, but the physician stood
            there until the man had completed what he had ordered him to do. He then let him go,
            suggesting that the best thing for him would be a mild, fatless diet and cool sour con
            presses. He prevented all evil consequences." <pb n="789" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>Al-Tartūshī, in his book "The Light of Kings," writes that a Syrian told him about a
            baker who was making bread in his oven in Damascus when a man passed by, selling
            apricots. The baker bought some and ate them with hot bread. When he had finished
            eating, he fainted, and by the time he was discovered he was dead. People clustered
            round him, brought some physicians and looked for signs of life, but, finding none,
            concluded that he must be dead. He was washed, shrouded and prayed for, and then carried
            out to the cemetery. While the mourners were on their way, at the gate of the city they
            met a skilled and learned physician called al-Yabrūdī. He heard the people discuss what
            had happened to the man, and asked them to tell the whole story. After he had heard it
            through, he said: "Put him down and let me examine him." They put him down, and he
            started moving him about, looking for such signs of life as were known to him. He then
            opened the man's mouth and poured some liquid down his throat or, according to another
            version, he gave him an enema, and lo! whatever was there was dislodged and expelled.
            The man opened his eyes, said something, and then went straight back to his shop.</p>
          <p>Al-Yahrūdī died in Damascus in the year 4—/1—- and was buried in the Jacobite church
            there, near Thomas' Gate. In this connection, Shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raʿhīm b.
            ʿAlī told me a story, by the following chain of transmission: Muwaffaq al Dīn Asʿad b.
            Ilyās the Metropolitan's son; his maternal uncle; the latter's father; ʿAbd Allāh b.
            Rajā b. Yaʿqūb; b. al-Kitānī, who was in charge of the Sultan's affairs in Damascus. The
            latter heard from Abū al-Faraj Jūrjis b. Yūḥanna that when al-Yabrūdī died, he left
            three hundred bezants, melted down into bullion, and live hundred pieces of silver, the
            smallest of which was valued at three hundred dirhams. Muwaffaq al-Dīn explains: "This
            is not much, for a person who is established in business, well-intentioned and <pb
              n="790" ed="kopf"/> truth-loving, who acts justly and endeavors to be adept in his
            profession, has a right before God to his earnings. On the other hand, if a person is
            the opposite of the above, he lives as a pauper and dies in disgrace."</p>
          <p>Al-Yabrūdī wrote a treatise proving that the body temperature of the chick is lower
            than that of the grown fowl and a refutation of Ibn al-Muwaffaqi's opinion as to
            problems of the pulse they had been discussing.</p>

            al-Bāhilī, of Murcia in Andalusia, was distinguished in the philosophical sciences,
            well-versed in medicine, interested in literature and famous for his poetry. He was a
            good conversationalist, had a sense of humor, and loved parties and entertainment. Many
            of his poems purport to be dirges for his contemporaries, but his intention in writing
            them was jocular. He took great pleasure in drinking and did so copiously. Being highly
            imaginative, he frequently improvised poetry, such as the verse:</p>
          <quote><p><l>O hunter of gifts, there's work for you;</l><l> Get up early and bring the

          <p>He was also a musician: he played the lute. His medical office was in Jīrūn, while his
            residence, a stone building, was in al-Labādīn. He wrote many eulogies for the Banū
            al-Sūfī, who were the rulers of Damascus during the reign of Mujīr al-Dīn Abaq b.
            Muḥammad b. Būrī b. Atābeg Tughtikīn.</p>
          <p>Abū al-Hakam traveled to Baghdād and al-Basrah and then returned to Damascus, where he

            eulogies praising his ruler. He also wrote books dedicated to him, for which he received
            numerous benefits and tokens of appreciation. Hakīm al-Zamān ʿAbd al-Munʿim concerned
            himself also with chemistry. He died in Damascus in the year 600/1200, leaving a son,
            ʿAbd al-Mu'min b. ʿAbd al-Munʿim. The latter was an oculist and a poet, he, too, wrote
            many eulogies. He was oculist to al-Malik al-Ashraf, Abū al-Fath Mūsa b. al-Malik
            al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr b. Ayyūb, and died in Edessa in the year 62-/122-.</p>
          <p>The following is a specimen of the poetry of Hakim al-Zamān ʿAbd al-Munʿim al Jilyānī
            which I have copied from his manuscript. I also heard it from my father, who obtained it
            through the above-mentioned physician, ʿAbd al-Mu'min. It is a eulogy to al-Malik
            al-Nāsir Salāh al-Dīn Abū al-Muzaffar Yūsuf b. Ayyūb and was sent to him from Damascus
            to his camp, al-Mansūr, on the outskirts of Acre, when he was besieging the Franks who
            were storming the city. It was brought before Salāh al-Dīn in the month of Safar,
            587/February 1191. This poem is entitled "The Precious Gem." [The very long poem
            follows.] </p>
          <p>He also wrote the following:</p>
          <quote><p><l>He recovered from his illness after revealing to me the symptoms he had
                previously kept hidden;</l><l> For if a doctor knows what ails his patient, he will
                undoubtedly bring him relief.</l><l> How many hide their condition, covering up
                their illness perversely!</l><l> When love takes a man prisoner and he is lost in
                its abundant charms, blinded by its glowing light.  <pb n="799" ed="kopf"/></l><l>
                That man, possessed by his desire, if he has no one with whom to take refuge, will
                stay in its grip.</l></p></quote>
          <p>In another poem he says:</p>
          <quote><p><l>I exerted myself studying medicine, so that I might not be in need of gifts
                from princes. </l><l> I was right to immunize myself by studying;</l><l> A man must
                secure his livelihood, but he should do it the right way: </l><l> Come close to the
                mighty by humility, but avoid submission to them. </l></p></quote>
          <p>He also wrote:</p>
          <quote><p><l>O you, who hate an ointment, you will see that it is better than to preserve
                modesty; </l><l> In forty days it serves the body better than anything else, but
                </l><l> A rebel will not recover unless he overcomes his passion.</l></p></quote>

            he settled there and practiced medicine. He was unique in this field in his generation,
            and convened a general conference of those practicing that profession. Once he went to
            Egypt and stayed in Cairo for a while, but afterwards he returned to Damascus and
            remained there until his death. He served as physician to al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn
            Maḥmūd b. Zanki. He was moreover interested in rhetoric, composing a great number of
            speeches which he dedicated to Nūr al-Dīn, in whose esteem he ranked high. He wrote
            missives to the inhabitants of the other provinces. For many years he worked in the

          <p>The physician sent what was asked of him. He remained in the service of Nūr al-Dīn

            Damascus. When al-Malik al-Nāsir Salah al-Dīn became ruler of Damascus, Muhadhdhab
            al-Dīn served him and was greatly favored by him. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn was a kindly man. He
            preferred solitude and did not marry nor leave any children. He died, may God have mercy

          <head><persName>Sukra of Aleppo</persName></head>
          <p> was a minor Jewish Shaykh in Aleppo, a skilled medical practitioner and
            well-acquainted with drugs. The Shaykh Safī al-Dīn Halīl b. Abū al-Fādil b. Mansūr of
            Tanūkh, the scribe of Laodicea, told me the following: When al-Malik al-ʿĀdil was in
            Aleppo, he had a maiden in the castle there of whom he was very fond. Once, that maiden
            became seriously ill. The Sultan had to go to Damscus, but his heart remained with her.
            He kept asking about her, but her illness persisted even though some of the best
            physicians were attending her. Then the physician Sukra was summoned to examine her. He
            found that she had a poor appetite, was moody and made no attempt to get up from her
            bed. He came several times with the other physicians, and then asked the servant
            permission to enter alone. This having been granted, he went in and said to her: "O
            mistress, I can give you a treatment which, God willing, will cure you speedily, so that
            you will need nothing else." She agreed to be treated and he said: "I want you to answer
            all my questions and hide nothing from me." She again agreed, and he made her swear to
            it. Then he asked: "Where do you come from?" — "I am from ʿAlān." — "The ʿAlānis in
            their homeland are Christians. Tell me, what did you eat mostly at home?" — "Cow's
            meat." — "And what wine did you usually drink?"</p>
          <p>Such and such." — "Rejoice, for you are cured!" He went home, bought a calf,
            slaughtered it and cooked part of it. He then brought a plate with a piece of meat
            roasted in milk and garlic, with a thin sheet of bread over it, and placed it in front
            of her, saying: "Eat!" She felt her appetite whetted, dipped the meat in the milk and
            garlic sauce and ate her fill. When she had finished, he took a small <pb n="804"
              ed="kopf"/> vessel from his pocket, saying: "This is a drink which will do you good —
            take it!" She drank and felt sleep come upon her, whereupon he wrapped her in a warm fur
            mantle; she then perspired heavily and later awoke in good health. He repeated this
            treatment on the following two days, until the cure was complete. In recognition of his
            services, she gave him a trayful of jewels, whereupon he said: "I nevertheless want you
            to write to the Sultan about the nature of your illness, and that you were cured by me."
            She promised to do so and wrote the letter, stressing how grateful she was to the
            physician; she maintained that she had been about to die and been saved by the only
            person who proved able to cure her, despite several attempts by other physicians. She
            then asked the Sultan to reward Sukra. After taking note of the contents of the letter,
            the Sultan sent for him, rewarded him and said: "We are grateful to you for your
            treatment." The physician replied: "O master, she was indeed on the brink of death, but
            Allāh the Omnipresent granted her health through me, so that she might live the rest of
            her allotted days." Pleased with this answer, the Sultan said: "Ask whatever you wish,
            and I shall give it to you." He replied, "O master, give me ten acres of land, five in
            the village of Samʿ and five in the village of ʿIndān." The Sultan answered: "I shall
            give it to you with full rights of purchase and sale, so that it will remain yours
            forever." He wrote an order to this effect and moreover gave Sukra a robe of honor.
            Sukra went back to Aleppo, where he accumulated great wealth. His fortune lasted so that
            his children also benefited by it.</p>

          <p> The Shaykh and learned Imām Najm al-Dīn Abū al-Futūh Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. al-Sūrī,
            known as Ibn al-Salāh, had both profound and detailed knowledge in the philosophical
            sciences. He was eloquent, expressed himself clearly and wrote wittily. He was also a
            distinguished physician. Ibn al-Salāh was a Persian, originating from Hamadān, and lived
            in Baghdad. Hisam al-Dīn Tumurtāsh b. al-Ghāzī b. Urtuq had him come to him, and honored
            him greatly, and he stayed with this ruler for a while. He then traveled to Damascus and
            lived there until his death — may God have mercy upon him — which occurred on a Sunday
            night in the year 540/1145 . . . . . . . . . . He was buried in the tombs of the Sufīs,
            near the River Banyas, outside Damascus.</p>
            Abū Zakariyā Yaḥyā b. Ismāʿil al-Bayāsī, may God have mercy upon him: The shaykh, the
          <p>I have copied the following from a manuscript of the Shaykh, the physician Amīn al-Dīn
            learned imām and philosopher Abū al-Futūʿh b. al-Salāh, arrived in Damascus from Baghdad
            and stayed with the learned Shaykh, the physician Abū al-Fadl Ismaīl b. Abū al-Waqqār.
            Ibn al-Salah wished to obtain some Baghdādi shoes and asked for a man who could make
            some good ones. A man named Saʿdān the Shoemaker was pointed out to him, and he ordered
            shoes from him. When they were ready, Ibn al-Salāh found them too narrow, too long, and
            of bad workmanship, so that he repeatedly decried him, his work and those who bought
            from him. Shaykh Abū al-Hakam, the physician of the Maghrib, on hearing about this
            episode, composed the following jocular poem, in which he used many logical,
            philosophical and geometrical terms . . . . . . . . . . [The long poem follows.]</p>
          <p>Ibn al-Salāh, wrote a treatise on the fourth form — ascribed to Galen — of valid
            syllogisms and a compendium of philosophy. </p>

          <head><persName>Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī.</persName></head>
          <p> The learned and virtuous Imām Abū Hafs ʿUmar b. . . . . [lacuna] was unique in his
            wide knowledge <pb n="806" ed="kopf"/>of the philosophical sciences. He was an expert
            lawyer, a great sage of truly orthodox views, and an eloquent stylist. Whoever debated
            with him was defeated by his arguments; whatever subject was explored by him was
            enhanced by his achievements. But his knowledge was greater that his prudence. The
            Shaykh Sadīd al-Dīn Maḥmūd b. ʿAmr told me that Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī frequently
            visited his Shaykh, Fakhr al-Dīn al Māridīnī, and was friendly with him. Shaykh Fakhr
            al-Dīn used to say to Sadīd al-Dīn, "How gifted, how brilliant this youth is! I have
            never found anyone like him in my generation; but I fear that the combined effect of his
            great rashness and passion and his bad memory will bring about his downfall." Sadīd
            al-Dīn continues: "When Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī left us, going from the east to
            Syria, he came to Aleppo, where he carried on discussions with its lawyers, none of whom
            could compete with him. Wherefore they hated him bitterly. The Sultan al-Malik al-Zāhir
            Ghāzī b. al-Malik al-Nāsir Salāh al-Dīn Yūsuf b. Ayyub summoned him, as well as the most
            notable scholars, lawyers and theologians, in order that they might hold a philosophical
            debate before him. They held a long debate, in which Shihāb al-Dīn's superiority was
            indisputable, his knowledge dazzling. His performance pleased al-Malik al-Zāhir, who
            favored him and in time made him his intimate friend. This only added to the hatred of
            those people, so they prepared records of his alleged atheism and sent them to Damascus,
            to al-Malik al-Nāsir Salāh al-Dīn, saying: 'If this man stays, he will corrupt the faith
            of al-Malik al-Zāhir; if he is exiled, he will corrupt any region in which he settles.'
            They added many other remarks of this kind. Salāh al-Dīn sent his son al-Malik al Zāhir
            in Aleppo a letter in the handwriting of the Judge al-Fādil, asking him to verify the
            above allegations and saying. 'This al-Shihāb al-Suhrawardī <pb n="807" ed="kopf"/> must
            be killed, for he can neither be banished nor be allowed to stay.' When Shihāb al-Dīn
            al-Suhrawardī heard this, he realized that he was doomed; he asked to be left in a
            secluded place and be denied food and drink until he met Allāh the Glorious. This was
            done late in the year 586/1190 in the fortress of Aleppo, when he was about thirty-six
            years old." The Shaykh Sadīd al-Dīn Mahmud b. ʿUmar concludes; "When our master, Fakhr
            al-Dīn of Māridīn, heard of his death, he said to us: 'Did I not tell you so, was I not
            worried about him?'"</p>
          <p>Ibn Abū Usaybiʿah continues: "It is said that Sihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī was adept in
            natural magic and performed well authenticated miracles in this field. The physician
            Ibrāhīm b. Abū al-Fadl b. Sadaqa told me that he once met him outside the Gate of Escape
            and they went in the direction of the Great Plain, accompanied by a group of students
            and others. The conversation turned to that science, its wonders and the Shaykh's
            knowledge of it. He listened as he walked along, and then exclaimed: 'How beautiful
            Damascus is and how beautiful this place!' We looked and saw in the east high
            whitewashed walls, close to each other and apparently of fine construction. There was an
            enclosure with large windows, in which could be seen women of unequaled beauty. Singing
            voices were heard, intertwining trees arose before us, and broad rivers were flowing. We
            had not known this place before and were greatly astonished, everybody was delighted at
            the view." The physician Ibrāhīm goes on: "We continued to see it for a while, but then
            it vanished and we again saw what we had been accustomed to see there for a long time.
            When I saw that wonderful sight, I felt as in a trance; my perceptive faculty was not
            the same as usual."</p>
          <p>Some Persian sages told me that when they were once in al-Qābān, on their way from
            Damascus, in the company of the Shaykh Shihāb al-Dīn, they met a flock of sheep tended
            by a Turk. They said to the <pb n="808" ed="kopf"/> Shaykh: "O master, we would like one
            of these sheep to eat." He said: "I have ten dirhams, take them and buy a sheep." So we
            bought a sheep from him. As we went on, we were overtaken by the Turk's friend, who
            said: "Give back that sheep and take a smaller one, that man didn't know what he was
            selling you. The sheep you bought is worth the two Persian camels you have, much more
            than what he took from you as its price." We bargained with him until the Shaykh noticed
            it and said: "Take the sheep and go; I shall stay here and settle things with him." We
            went on and he stayed, talking and arguing with the man. After we had walked a little
            further he left him and followed us. The Turk went after him shouting, but he paid no
            attention to him and did not say a word. The Turk finally reached him, in great anger,
            seized his left hand and cried: "Where are you going, leaving me behind?" Suddently the
            Shaykh's arm came off his shoulder; it was left in the Turk's hand with blood flowing.
            The Turk almost fainted with astonishment, threw the arm down and ran away. The Shaykh
            returned, picked up the arm with his right hand and rejoined us. The Turk kept looking
            back at us until he disappeared. When the Shaykh reached us, there was nothing in his
            right hand but his handkerchief."  </p>
          <p>Safi al-Dīn Hālīl b. Abū al-Fadl the Scribe told me the following in the name of the
            Shaykh Diyā' al-Dīn b. Saqrar, may God have mercy upon him. In the year 579/1183, the
            Shaykh Shihāb al-Dīn ʿUmar al-Suhrawardī came to Aleppo and stayed at Halāwiyah College.
            Its rector in those days was the illustrious head of the Hanafiya school, Iftikhār
            al-Dīn, may God bless him. When Shihāb al-Dīn attended a lesson and argued with the
            lawyers, he wore a weasel-skin mantle and carried a ewer and a shepherd's wooden stall.
            No one knew him, but when he argued and distinguished himself among the lawyers,
            Iftikhār al-Dīn, recognizing his merit, took a coarse robe, a tunic, a long outer
            garment and a vest, <pb n="809" ed="kopf"/> handed them to his son and said: "Go up to
            that beggar and tell him, 'My father sends you his regards and says that you are a
            learned person. He asks you to attend his lesson with the other lawyers and sends you
            these things to wear when you come.'" When the son come to Shihāb al-Dīn and gave him
            his father's message, Shihāb al-Dīn fell silent for a while, and then said: "O my son,
            put these clothes down and please do me a favor." He brought out a ruby-coloured
            hyacinth stone as big as a chicken's egg the like of which in size and color nobody had
            possessed before, and said: "Go to the market and auction off this stone, but whatever
            be the bid, do not sell it without first letting me know." Iftikhār al-Dīn's son went to
            the market and sat with the auctioneer to sell the stone. The price went up to
            twenty-five thousand dirhams. The auctioneer took the stone to al-Malik al-Zāhir Ghāzī
            b. Salāh al-Dīn, then the ruler of Aleppo, and said: "Twenty-five thousand dirhams were
            bid for this stone." Al-Malik al-Zahir marveled at its size and color, found it most
            beautiful and bid thirty thousand dirhams for it. The auctioneer said: "Wait until I
            have informed Iftikhār al-Dīn's son of this bid." He went back to the market, returned
            the stone to Iftikhār al Dīn's son and said: "Go and consult your father about this
            offer," thinking the stone belonged to Iftikhār al-Dīn. When Iftikhār al-Dīn's son
            informed Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī of the price offered for the stone, the latter
            looked stern, then took the stone, placed it on a boulder, and smashed it with another
            boulder, saying to Iftikhār al-Dīn's son: "Take, O my son, these clothes, go back to
            your father, kiss his hand for me, and say: 'Had I desired clothes, I would not have
            destroyed the stone." Iftikhār al-Dīn's son went to his father and told him the whole
            story, which left Iftikhār al-Dīn perplexed. As for al-Malik al-Zāhir, he sought out the
            auctioneer and demanded the stone of him. The <pb n="810" ed="kopf"/> auctioneer said:
            "O master, it was taken back by the person who brought it, the son of the illustrious
            Iftikhār al-Dīn, the Rector of al-Halāwiya."</p>

          <p>The Sultan rode to the university, sat in the great hall and called for Iftikhār
            al-Dīn, saying: "I want that stone." The rector told him that it belonged to a poor man
            who was staying with him. The Sultan thought this over and said — "O Iftikhār al-Dīn, if
            my conjecture is right, that man is Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrwardī." He than rose, found
            Shihāb al-Dīn, took him to his castle and raised him to a lofty status. Shihāb al-Dīn
            would argue with the lawyers of all schools and defeat them all; then he began to slight
            the people of Aleppo and talk to them haughtily, until they became violently hostile to
            him, decided upon his death, and brought it about. It is said that al-Malik al-Zāhir
            sent an assassin to him, and afterwards took revenge upon those who had decided to kill
            him. He seized and imprisoned some of them, humiliated them and confiscated great sums
            of money from them.</p>
          <p>Sadīd al-Dīn Maḥmūd b. ʿOmar, known as b. Ruqaīqa, told me the following: "The Shaykh
            Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī dressed poorly, paid no attention to his appearance, and
            cared nothing for the affairs of this world. We were once strolling together in the
            Mosque of Mayā-Fāriqūn, he wearing a frayed, short upper gown, a kerchief round his
            head, and leather boots, when a friend of mine saw me, came over to me and said: 'How
            can you keep company with such a crazy wretch?' I hushed him, saying that this was the
            master of our generation, Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī. My friend withdrew in extreme
            bewilderment."</p>
          <p>An inhabitant of Aleppo told me that when Shihāb al-Dīn, may God have mercy upon him,
            died and was buried on the outskirts of the city, an ancient poem was inscribed on his
            tomb . . . . . . . . <pb n="811" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>Among his sayings is a prayer to God: "O mainstay of existence, unending source of all
            good, abode of blessings and goal of all desires, author of light and ruler of
            everything; giver of life in both worlds, extend to us your light, teach us how to
            please you, inspire us by your guidance and purify us from the stain of sin, save us
            from the darkness of our nature to witness your light, see your sights, be near your
            worshipers and the inhabitants of your kingdom; join us with those who enjoy your favor
            — the angels, the just, the prophets and the apostles."</p>
          <p>A specimen of the poetry of Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī is . . . . . . . . [tinged with
            Sūfism]. He recited a poem when he was dying, offering himself up to death . . . . . . .

          <p> The distinguished imām, perfect savant and eminent judge Shams al-Dīn, "the Advocate
            of Islām," the master of the learned and wise, Abū al-ʿAbbās Aḥmad b. al-Khalīl b.
            Saʿādah b. Jaʿfar b. ʿĪsā, of the city of Khiwā, was unique among his generation in the
            philosophical sciences and a prodigy of religious jurisprudence. He was acquainted with
            the principles of medicine and the other branches of science. He was brilliant and yet
            humble, of handsome appearance, <pb n="812" ed="kopf"/> noble-minded and kind. He was,
            may God bless him, zealous in prayer, fasting and the reading of the Qur'ān. When he
            arrived in Syria during the reign of the Sultan al-Malik al-Muʿazzam ʿĪsā b. al-Malik al
            ʿAdil, the latter sent for him, heard him speak and found him foremost in his generation
            in all the sciences. Al-Malik al-Muʿazzam was himself adept in religious law. He favored
            Shams al-Dīn and treated him generously, granting him a salary and privileges. He
            esteemed him so much that he installed him in Damascus, placing a dwelling at his
            disposal. A group of students studied under him. I would visit him and study Ibn
            Sahlān's "Demonstration" with him. He was eloquent, having a clear and beautiful diction
            and a fine character. His master was the Imam Fakhr al-Dīn, son of the preacher of
            al-Rayy, with whom he studied until al-Malik al-Muʿazzam made him Chief Justice of
            Damascus. Despite his high station, he remained very modest; he was soft-spoken, went to
            the mosque on foot and attended all the prayers punctually. His literary works are
            outstanding. He lived and taught at ʿAdiliyyah University until his premature death, may
            God have mercy upon him, of hectic fever. He died in Damascus on the 7th of Shaʿbān,
            637/1239.</p>

          <p> The venerable judge and learned Imām, Rafīʿ al-Dīn Abū Ḥāmid ʿAbd alʿAzīz b. ʿAbd
            al-Wahib b. Ismaʿīl b. ʿAbd al-Hādī al-Jīlī originated from Fīlmān but acquired his
            reputation in al-Gilān. He was pre-eminent in the philosophical sciences, the principles
            of religion, religious jurisprudence, the natural sciences and medicine. He lived in
            Damascus and was a lecturer in law at ʿAdrāwīyya University, inside the Gate of Victory.
            He held seminars for his students in the different branches of sciences and medicine. I
            studied some philosophy with him. He was eloquent, very wise, and read abundantly. For a
            short time he served as a judge in Baʿalbekk. He was a close friend of the governor,
            Amīn al-Dawlal, and when the Sultan al-Malik al-Sālih Imād al-Dīn Ismaʿīl became ruler
            of Damascus and the Chief Justice Shams al-Dīn of Chiva died — may God have mercy upon
            him — Amīn al-Dawlah suggested that Rafīʿ al-Dīn should replace the latter. So the
            Sultan made him Chief Justice of Damascus. His prestige increased, he became wealthy,
            and continued in this condition for some time. But many people complained of ways he had
            committed and vehemently denounced his conduct. Things came to such a pass that he was
            seized and done to death — may God have mercy upon him — during the reign of al-Malik
            al-Sālih Ismaʿīl. Following a quarrel between him and the Vizier Amīn al-Dawlah, he was
            sent with an escort of vizierial officers to a place near Baʿalbekk, where there was a
            yawning abyss known as the Cave of Afqa. There people were told to pinion his arms
            behind his back and after doing so push him into the abyss. One of those present told me
            that when he was pushed, he was smashed by the fall, but it seems that his clothes
            caught on the side of the cave's lower part. The people stayed there for about three
            days, listening to his groaning, which became weaker and weaker, until it stopped and
            they were sure that he was dead; then they went away. <pb n="814" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>Ibn Abū Usaybiʿah adds: "It is curious to note that the Judge Rafīʿ al-Dīn went over a
            copy of this book in my presence, in which I did not mention him." He read as far as the
            passage concerning Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī and was much impressed by it He said,
            "You have mentioned him, but omitted others better than he," meaning himself. He added:
            Shihāb al-Dīn's story is indeed woeful, but he died after attending his goal; may the
            Omnipotent grant me to die like him; praise be to God, who determines the fate of his
            creatures according to his will." The Judge Rafīʿ al-Dīn died in the month of Dhū
            al-Hijja, 641/1243. When he became Chief Justice of Damascus in 638/1240, the following
            poem was composed in his honour . . . . . . . .</p>

          <p> The honorable Shams al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Hamīd b. ʿĪsā came from Khosrushāh, an estate near
            Tibrīz. He was an eminent scholar and physician, a model to mankind and glory to Islam.
            He distinguished himself in the philosophical sciences, was well-versed in the
            principles of medicine and possessed a perfect knowledge of the religious sciences. He
            studied untiringly and constantly added virtue to merit. He was one of the best pupils
            of the master Fakhr al-Dīn b. al-Habil of al-Ray. Upon his arrival in Syria, he served
            the Sultan al-Malik al-Nasir Salāh al-Dīn Dā'ud b. al-Malik al-Muʿazzam, staying with
            him at al-Karak, where he <pb n="815" ed="kopf"/>was held in high honor and received
            numerous favors and gifts. He then went to Damascus and lived there until his death —
            may God bless him — in the month of Shawwāl, 652/1254. He was buried on Mount Qasiyūn.
            When he arrived in Damascus and I met him, I found an old man of pleasant bearing,
            eloquent, wise and very learned. I was visiting him one day when a Persian lawyer
            brought him a book written in minute characters, one eighth the size of Baghdādi script,
            arranged according to the Muʿtazilah system. After examining it, Shams al-Dīn kissed it
            and placed it on his head. Upon my question, he said: "This is the script of our master,
            the Imam Fakhr al-Dīn b. al-Hatib of al-Rayy, may Allāh have mercy upon him." I esteemed
            him all the more for the respect he showed toward his master.</p>
          <p>When Shams al-Dīn of Khosrushāh died, may God have mercy upon him, the Shaykh ʿIzz
            al-Dīn Muḥammad b. Hasan al-Gahawī al-Darīr al-Arbalī composed a eulogy in his honor . .

            one of his most honored favorites. He served that ruler until the latter's death in the
            year 617/1220, when he went to Damascus. When he arrived there, al-Malik al-Muʿazzam
            Sharaf al-Dīn b. al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr b. Ayyūb gave him numerous benefices,
            honored him greatly and placed him in charge of education. When he came to the
            university and gave a lesson to the lawyers there, everyone was astonished at his
            excellent discourse on debate and research. Nobody equaled him in any of the sciences,
            but he seldom taught in the philosophic sciences. </p>
          <p>I was vouchsafed to his "Treasures of Symbols" under him only because of the great

          <p>When I first met him, I had come to his house with my father; it faced a paved coutyard
            near Ādiliyyah University in Damascus. After greeted him we sat down, being welcomed
            with amiable words. He looked at us and said: "I have never seen a father and son more
            like each other." The Commander Fakhr al-Qudāt b. Yasāqah recited to me the following
            poem about himself, which he wrote after al-Imād b. al-Salmāsī had interceded for him
            with Saif al-Dīn al-Āmidī in order that the latter might accept him as a student . . . .
            . . . . . .</p>
          <p>Ibn Abū Usaybiʿah continues: "This poem contains a play on the word saif [sword] in the
            manner of the poet Abū Tamām."</p>
          <p>Saif al-Dīn stayed in Damascus until his death — may God have mercy upon him — on the
            4th of Safar, 631/1232. Here is a sample of his poetry, a piece which he wrote about
            himself and which I obtained from his son, Jamāl al-Dīn Muḥammad, who heard it from his
            father . . . . . . . . [the poem follows]. <pb n="817" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>Saif al-Dīn al-Amidī wrote the following books:</p>

          <p> The physician, Imām, scholar and virtuous person, Muwaffaq al-Dīn Abū Nasr Asʿad b.
            Abū al-Fath Ibyas, the son of Jinjis the Bishop, was a leading philosopher, a unique
            expert in theology, kind and generous, the master of his generation in the theory and
            practice of medicine, peerless in the knowledge and application of its principles, a
            gentle and efficient therapeutist. He was adept in the philosophical sciences, devoted
              <pb n="818" ed="kopf"/> to the literary arts; he studied grammar, language and
            literature successfully under the Shaykh and Imām Taj al-Dīn Abū al-Yaman Zaid b.
            al-Ḥasan al-Qindī. Muwaffaq al-Dīn b. al-Mutrān was born and brought up in Damascus. His
            father was also a very competent physician, who roamed the world in quest of virtue. He
            traveled to Byzantium to acquaint himself thoroughly with the principles and different
            schools of thought of Christianity, in which he believed. Later he went to Iraq and met
            Amīn al-Dawlah b. al-Tilmīdh, under whom he studied medicine for a while, reading many
            text books, until he required a reputation as a physician. Afterwards he returned to
            Damascus and practiced medicine there to the end of his days.</p>
          <p>Muwaffaq al-Dīn b. al-Mūtrān was keen-witted, eloquent and erudite. His works prove his
            excellence in medicine and other sciences. He studied medicine under Muhadhdhab al-Dīn
            b. alNaqqāsh. He was a handsome man, particular about his dress, which he liked to be
            costly. He was physician to al-Malik al-Nasir Salāh al-Dīn Yūsuf b. Ayyūb and was highly
            favored by that ruler, who made him his chamberlain and chief of his household, a post
            for which he paid him extremely well. Salāh al-Dīn, may God have mercy upon him, was of
            noble character and very generous to those who served him and to everyone who asked his
            assistance, so much so that when he died, his treasury was found empty. He esteemed b.
            al-Mutrān highly and took him with him wherever he went, until he spoilt him by the
            abundance of his favors and gifts. Ibn al-Mutrān became conceited, thinking himself even
            above kings. Salāh al-Dīn was aware of this feature in him, but pardoned it as he
            respected him for his learning. Ibn al-Mutrān converted to Islam during Salāh al-Dīn's
            reign.</p>
          <p>Someone who knew b. al-Mutrān — his self-love and familiarity with Salāh al-Dīn — told
            me that he once accompanied the Sultan <pb n="819" ed="kopf"/> on one of his campaigns.
            During a campaign, Salāh al-Dīn would live in a red hut, with a red antechamber and
            passageway. One day, Salāh al-Dīn was riding about when he suddently saw a red tent with
            a red passageway and privy. He contemplated it for a while and then asked whose it was.
            When told that it belonged to the physician, Ibn al-Mutrān, he said, "By Allāh, I
            thought it was a product of Ibn al-Mutran's vanity." He laughed, but then added: "If a
            messenger passes by, he will think it belongs to a king; this being so, he must change
            at least the privy." He ordered it to be destroyed. This was done, and Ibn al-Mutrān
            took it very hard; he kept to himself for a couple of days and did not offer his usual
            services. The Sultan, seeking to propitiate him, gave him some money.</p>
          <p>In this connection, the same source told me another anecdote.  There was in the service
            of Salāh al-Dīn a physician called Abū al-Karaj the Christian. .He served the Sultan for
            a long time and had access to his private apartments. One day he told the Sultan that
            his daughters needed dowries and asked his help in the matter. Salāh al-Dīn ordered him
            to make a list of everything required and hand it to him. Abū al-Faraj listed jewels,
            fabrics, tools, etc. to the value of about thirty thousand dirhams. When Salāh al-Dīn
            had read the list, he ordered his treasurer to buy Abū al-Faraj everything included in
            it. When Ibn al-Mutrān heard of this episode, he curtailed his services and Salāh al-Dīn
            noticed that he did not look well. He guessed the reason and ordered his treasurer to
            work out the total price of what he had bought for Abū al-Faraj the Physician and then
            pay b. al-Mutrān a similar sum. This was done. </p>
          <p>Abū al-Zāhir Ismāʿīl, who knew Ibn al-Mutrān intimately, told me that the
            self-admiration and arrogance which characterized Ibn al-Mutrān were entirely absent in
            his student days. He used to see <pb n="820" ed="kopf"/> Ibn al-Mutrān during the time
            that the latter was studying grammar at the mosque. Ibn al-Mutrān would come there after
            his service at the Sultan's palace, with a numerous retinue of horsemen, Turkish slaves
            and others; but when he approached the mosque, he dismounted took the books he was
            studying in his hand or under his arm, let none of the servants accompany him and
            continued on foot, with the books, to the group of the Shaykh under where he was
            studying; he greeted the Shaykh and sat among the group, intelligent and quiet, until he
            finished his lesson and returned to his previous company.</p>
          <p>The governor and honorable judge, Jamāl al-Dīn Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. Yūsuf b. Ibrāhīm
            al-Qiftī, said that the physician, Muwaffaq al-Dīn Asʿad b. al-Mutrān, a Christian,
            became a good Muslim after his conversion. Al-Malik al-Nasir Salāh al-Dīn, may Allāh
            sanctify his soul, married him to one of his palace favorites, named Jawzah. Jawzah was
            a servant of Honadhātūn, daughter of Muʿin al-Dīn and wife of Salāh al-Dīn. She was her
            chief stewardess and favorite maidservant, so he gave her a great deal of jewelry and
            other precious articles, as well as monetary and other benefits. After her marriage to
            Ibn al-Mutrān, she put his affairs in order, took care of his business, beautified his
            dress, and improved both his appearance and his character. He thus became a famous man
            and acquired great wealth by treating the state dignitaries when they were ill; they
            vied with each other in rewarding his services. His position with the Sultan was so
            exalted that he was almost a vizier.</p>
          <p>He made a point of attracting people who specialized in medicine and philosophy, in
            order to advance them and help them earn a living. The above-mentioned informant told me
            that the lawyer Ismāʿīl b. Sālim b. al-Banā-al-Qiftī, the preacher of ʿIdāb, related to
            him as follows. </p>
          <p>When the Sultan had conquered the coastal region, I traveled from ʿIdab to visit
            Jerusalem. On arriving in Syria, after leaving the arid <pb n="821" ed="kopf"/> ʿIdāb I
            saw wooded hillsides and desired to settle there; but I did not know how to make a
            living. I turned to the pious ʿAbd al-Raḥīm and asked him for a letter to the Sultan,
            recommending me for the post of preacher in the fortress of Kerak. He wrote such a
            letter full of kindness, which is included in the collection of his correspondence. I
            took it to Damascus, where the Sultan was staying, but was instructed to show it to Ibn
            al-Mutrān. I went to the latter's house, which I entered with his permission, and found
            him to be of pleasant appearance and temper, an amenable listener and talker. His house
            struck me as the essence of beauty as to construction and furnishings, with water
            springing from pipes in his pool, which were of pure gold and excellent workmanship. The
            slave named ʿUmar, who served as his chamberlain, was extremely handsome. There were
            carpets and rugs and exquisite fragrances that filled me with a sense of awe. I told him
            what I had come for, and he responded generously to my request." The Governor Jamāl
            al-Dīn concluded; "I saw his wife and the son of his chamberlain ʿUmar in Aleppo after
            the year 600/1203. They were comfortably off, living under the protection of al-Malik
            al-Zāhir, may God prosper his reign, on allowances that had been awarded to them. She
            died after a while, and I have not heard of the son of ʿUmar since.</p>
          <p>The Shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn b. al-Būrī, the Christian scribe, told me that when al-Malik
            al-Nāsir Salāh al-Dīn Yūsuf b. Ayyūb had conquered al-Kerak, the Christian physician
            Muwallaq al-Dīn Yaʿqūb b. Siqlāb, then a young man, came to Damascus. On his head he
            wore a shawl with a narrow band round it, and he was clad in a long-sleeved
            tight-fitting blue gown, the garb of the Frankish physicians. He went to Muwaffaq al-Dīn
            b. al-Mūtrān and began to cultivate him, hoping to benefit thereby. Muwaffaq al-Dīn told
            him: "This dress you are wearing will bring you no luck in medicine among the Muslims in
            this country. You should adopt the usual attire <pb n="822" ed="kopf"/> of the local
            physicians." He brought a wide ʿitābiyya robe and an attractive sleeveless bodice and
            told him to put them on. Then he said: "There is a great prince here named Maimūn
            al-Qasrī, who is ill and who is attended by me. Come with me and attend him yourself."
            When they arrived, Ibn al-Mutrān told the prince: "This is a skilled physician in whom I
            have complete confidence. Let him serve and treat you at all times and stay with you
            until you recover, God willing." The prince agreed, and the physician Yaʿqūb stayed with
            him day and night until he got well, for which he was rewarded with five hundred dinars.
            Upon receiving it, the physician went to Ibn al-Mutrān and said: "O master, that man has
            rewarded me, and I am bringing you the money." Said Ibn al-Mutrān, "Keep it, for I only
            intended to benefit you." He kept it and blessed him.</p>
          <p>The physician ʿIzz al-Dīn Abū Isḥāq Ibrāhīm b. Muḥammad b. al-Sawaidī told me the
            following story: Once Ibn al-Mūtrān was sitting at the door of his house, when a
            distinguished-looking young man, dressed as a soldier, came up to him and handed him a
            piece of paper on which were written twelve lines of poetry praising him. After reading
            them, Ibn al-Mutrān asked him if he was a poet. The youth replied: "I am not, but I come
            of a good family. I have fallen on evil days and have been given these short lines of
            verse in order to come here and place my fate in your hands so that you may direct me in
            the way your lofty mind sees fit." The physician entered his house and called to the
            youth to come in too. He offered him food, which he accepted, and then said to him:
            "ʿIzz al-Dīn Farihshāh, the Governor of Sarhad, has become stricken with a frequently
            recurring malady. I am thinking of sending you to attend him; he will pay you well. Said
            the youth: "But master, whence shall I obtain the necessary medical knowledge and
            skill?" — "Do not worry, I shall write out for you a schedule of treatment which you
            will follow to the letter." The youth pledged obedience, and on his way out was
            approached by a <pb n="823" ed="kopf"/> servant who gave him a bundle of clothes and a
            horse and bridle. The servant told him to put on the clothes, mount the horse and
            prepare himself to go to Sarhad. Said the youth: "But I have nowhere to leave the horse
            for the night." — "Leave it with us, and go tomorrow morning, with God's help." On the
            morrow, the youth came to Ibn al-Mutrān's house and received a letter of recommendation
            to ʿIzz al-Dīn Farihshāh, the Governor of Sarhad, in b. al-Mutrān's own hand, an expose
            of the method of treatment, and two hundred dirhams for traveling expenses. The youth
            rode to Sarhad and treated the Governor according to instructions, until he recovered
            and went to the hot baths. He honored the youth with an exquisite robe, gave him a mule
            and a saddle, a great quantity of gold and a thousand Egyptian dinars, and then asked
            him to remain in his service. The youth replied: "I cannot, O master, until I have
            consulted my shaykh, the physician Muwaffaq al-Dīn b. al-Mutrān." "Who is this Muwaffaq
            al-Dīn?" — "Why, he is only my brother's servant: You must not leave Sarhad." Upon being
            further pressed, he said: "I must go to my house, and then I will come back." He went
            home, fetched the honorary robe, the money and the rest, and said: "This is what you
            have given me. Take it back and let me go, for by Allāh, I know nothing about medicine —
            I only met the physician b. al-Mutrān." And he told him the whole story. ʿIzz al-Dīn
            said: "Do not worry, you do not have to be a physician. Do you know how to play
            backgammon and chess?" — "Of course" — for the youth was cultured and refined. ʿIzz
            al-Dīn thereupon declared: "I shall make you my chamberlain and allot you lands which
            will bring you twenty-two thousand dirhams yearly." The youth replied: "l promise you
            absolute obedience, O master; only ask leave to go to Damascus and see the physician
            Muwaffaq al-Dīn, so that I may kiss his hand and thank him for the service he has done
            to me." He was given leave, went to see Muwaffaq al-Dīn, kissed his hand and thanked him
            warmly. <pb n="824" ed="kopf"/> He then produced the gifts he had received, and said:
            "All this I have received, take it." Muwaffaq al-Dīn refused, saying: "I only intended
            to benefit you, keep everything and may Allāh's blessing go with it." The youth told him
            what had happened to ʿIzz al-Dīn and what post had been assigned to him. He remained in
            ʿIzz al-Dīn's service, and all his good fortune was due to the kindness of the physician
            Muwaffaq al-Dīn b. al-Mutrān.</p>
          <p>Ibn Abū Usaybiʿah continues: "Muwaffaq al-Dīn b. al-Mutrān was a great collector of
            books, so that, when he died, about ten thousand medical and other works were found in
            his library, besides those he had copied. He was much concerned with copying and
            correcting books, and there were three copyists in his permanent service, who received a
            salary and gifts from him. One of them was Jamāl al-Dīn, known as b. al-Jamāla, who
            wrote a neat well-proportioned hand. Ibn al-Mutrān copied many books himself; I have
            seen several such copies, and found them to be unsurpassable as to script, correctness
            and expressiveness. He read a great deal — in fact, most of the time. The majority of
            the books in his possession contain his corrections and notes in his handwriting. Many
            small books and individual medical essays were found in his library combined into single
            volumes; they had been accurately and neatly copied, in half one-eighth of Baghdādi
            script, some of them in his own hand. There were a great many of these small
            collections. He never left his house without a book in his pocket, which he would read
            at the gate of the Sultan's palace or wherever else he happened to be. After his death,
            all his books were sold, for he left no children."</p>
          <p>The physician ʿImrān al-Isrā'ili told me that he had attended the sale of Ibn
            al-Mutrān's books and those small collections split up into many thousands of different
            items, most of them copied by Ibn al-Jamāla. The Judge al-Fādil asked to see them, so a
            small box of such separate items was delivered to him. He looked at them, <pb n="825"
              ed="kopf"/> then sent them back, and they fetched three thousand dirhams at the
            auction. The physician ʿImrān bought most of them. He told me that he had reached an
            agreement with the heirs concerning the sale to the effect that they should sell each
            collection for one dirham. He bought those collections at that price by the number.</p>
          <p>Ibn Usaybiʿah continues: "Ibn al-Mutrān was very virtuous, of noble character, kind
            toward his disciples, to whom he gave books and other gifts. When one of them began to
            practice medicine, he gave him an honorary robe and showed a constant interest in him.
            His best student was the Shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm b. ʿAlī, may God have
            mercy upon him, who studied with him for a long time and accompanied him during the
            campaign in which Salāh al-Dīn conquered the coastal region. Shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn
            told me the following story about Ibn al-Mutrān's therapeutical proficiency: "Asad
            al-Dīn Shirkūh, the Governor of Homs, once sent for Ibn al-Mutrān. He went to see him
            with me. When we were on our way, a man afflicted with elephantiasis approached us. His
            illness was so grave that his face was disfigured and his complexion ruined. He asked
            Ibn al-Mutrān what drugs he should take, but the physician, visibly moved by the man's
            appearance, said: 'Eat viper's meat.' The man repeated his question, and Ibn al-Mutrān
            said again: 'Eat viper's meat, and you will recover.' We went on to Homs, where Ibn
            al-Mutrān looked after the patient for whose sake he had come, until he recovered. Then
            we returned. When we were on our way, a perfectly healthy clear-complexioned youth
            greeted us. He kissed Ibn al-Mutrān's hand, but the latter did not recognize him, and
            asked who he was. The youth introduced himself as the person who had complained to him
            of his illness. After following his advice, he had recovered without need of any other
            remedy. We marveled at the completeness of his recovery. He then took his leave and

          </p>
          <p>The same informant told me that he once accompanied Ibn al-Mutrān to the great hospital
            built by Nūr al-Dīn b. Zanghī, where he attended the patients. Among them was one who
            suffered so badly from ascites that he almost burst with it. At that time, Ibn Hamdān
            al-Jarā'ihī, a skillful therapeutist, was also at the hospital. They decided to lance
            the swelling. When the right place was lanced, yellow pus came out, while Ibn al-Mutrān
            watched the man's pulse. When he realized that patient could eject no more matter, he
            ordered the place to be compressed and the patient laid on his bed, without the bandage
            being changed. The man felt considerable relief. His wife was there with him, and b.
            al-Mutrān told her not to let her husband undo the bandage or change it in any way until
            he returned to examine it the following day. We went away, and when night came the man
            said to his wife: "I am well now, there is nothing wrong with me; those physicians only
            want to prolong my illness. Undo the bandage so that the rest of the pus may come out
            and I can go back to my work." She refused, but he repeated his request several times,
            not knowing that they had postponed the extraction of the rest of the pus as a
            precautionary measure in order to preserve his strength. When she undid the bandage, all
            the pus came out, his strength ebbed away and he died.</p>
          <p>Another story from the same source is the following: In the hospital, Muhadhdhab al-Dīn
            and Ibn al-Mutrān saw a man one of whose arms was paralyzed, as was the leg on the
            opposite side. Ibn al-Mutrān cured him speedily; he applied local treatment until he
            recovered completely. Ibn Abū Usaybiʿah continues: "Muwaffaq al-Dīn ʿAsʿad b. Illyā, the
            bishop's son, had two brothers, who were also physicians. One of them was Hibbat Allāh
            b. Ilyās, the other . . . . . . Ibn Ilyās. Muwaffaq-al-Dīn died in Damascus in Rabīʿ I;
            587/1191. From a manuscript of the poet ʿAbd al-Razzāq b. Aḥmad al ʿĀmirī I have <pb
              n="827" ed="kopf"/> copied a eulogy in honor of Ibn al-Mutrān, written after his
            conversion to Islam, on the 3rd of Ramadān, 585/1189. . . . . . . . "</p>

          <p>Muwaffaq al-Dīn wrote the following books: </p>
          <list>
            <item n="1"> "The Orchard of the Physicians and Garden of the Wise," in which he
              attempted to collect all the anecdotes, curiosities and apt definitions that he had
              read or heard from his masters. He did not finish this book; all I found of it were
              two parts, written by the hand of our master, the physician Muhadhdhab al-Dīn. The
              first had been proofread by Ibn al-Mutrān and bore his handwriting, but as for the
              second, Muhadhdhab al-Dīn told me that Ibn al-Mutrān died before proofreading
              it.</item>
            <item n="2"> "The Nasiriyya Treatise on the Preservation of Health." The author
              certainly achieved his aim of concise and effective presentation. The book is named
              after the Sultan al-Malik al-Nāsir Salāh al Dīn Yūsuf b. Ayyūb. I have found a copy of
              the first part written by Jamāl al-Dīn, known as Ibn al-Jamāla, who was Ibn
              al-Mutrān's scribe. This part has also been translated.</item>
            <item n="3"> "The Najmiyyah Treatise on Regimens." It seems to have been dedicated to
              Salāh al-Dīn's father Najm al-Dīn Ayyūb. Najm al-Dīn died before having received it,
              so it was named after his son.</item>

          <p> was a celebrated physician, learned in the medical art, well-versed in the exact
            sciences and interested in literature and grammar. He was born and bred in Damascus, and
            spent a long time studying medicine under Muhadhdhab al-Dīn b. al-Naqqāsh. He then
            traveled to Mosul with the physician Muwaffaq al-Dīn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz to study with the
            master Sharaf al-Dīn of Tūs, who was unique in his generation in the fields of
            philosophy, the exact sciences and others. They found that he had returned to Tūs, so
            they went to the latter place and stayed there for a while. Ibn al-Hājib then journeyed
            to Irbil, where the astronomer Fakhr al-Dīn b. al-Dahhān was staying. He studied under
            his direction. He acquainted himself thoroughly with the astronomical tables prepared by
            b. al-Dahhān, copied them with his own hand and then returned to Damascus.</p>
          <p>Ibn al-Dahhān was an astronomer from Baghdād, who was known as Abū Shagāʿ and nicknamed
            "the little fox," He lived in Mosul for twenty years and then went to Damascus and was
            honorably received by Salāh al-Dīn, al-Fādil and a group of notables there, earning
            thirty dinars per month. He was devoutly religious, would fast and mortify his flesh,
            and pray in seclusion for four months and more at the Mosque of Damascus. The closet in
            al-Kalasa was made for him. He wrote many books, including the following: the famous
            "Astronomical Tables," a neat and sound piece of work; "The Pulpit of Religious
            Obligations," a very celebrated book: "Ten Volumes of Rare Traditions"; a book on the
            disagreement of foods with the body, arranged as an almanac of health. He studied
            incessantly and wrote <pb n="829" ed="kopf"/> a great deal of poetry. He went on a
            pilgrimage to Mecca, but died in Baghdad on his way back, after being absent from that
            city for for more than forty years, and was buried beside his parents' tomb. Muhadhdhab
            al-Dīn b. al-Hājib studied assiduously, loved the sciences and was an authority on
            geometry. Before achieving fame as a physician, he worked with the clocks at the Mosque
            of Damascus. Afterwards he distinguished himself in medicine and became one of the
            leaders of the profession. He worked at the great hospital founded by al-Malik al-Ādil
            Nūr al-Dīn b. Zanghi and subsequently served Taqiyy al-Dīn ʿUmar, the Governor of Hamāt,
            until the latter's death. He then went back to Damascus and from there traveled to
            Egypt, where he served al-Malik al-Nāsir Salāh al-Dīn b. Ayyūb as a physician, and
            stayed in his service until that Sultan's death. Thereafter he went to al-Malik
            al-Mansūr b. Taqiyy al-Dīn, the Governor of Hamāt, and stayed about two years. He died
            of dropsy in Hamāt.</p>

            up in Damascus. His father Muḥammad moved from Khurasān to Syria, settled in Damascus
            and died there. He was unique among his generation in the field of chronometry and
            astronomy. It was he who made the clock at the Gate of the Mosque in Damascus. This was

            received many gifts, an allowance and a salary for determining the time. He held this

            al-Wāhid b. al-Labūdī, was in his time peerless in the philosophical sciences and in
            medicine. He traveled from Syria to Persia, where he studied philosophy under Najib
            al-Dīn Asʿad al-Hamdānī and medicine under one of the greatest savants, who had received
            his education from a disciple of Ibn Sahlān, through the intermediary of the illustrious
            Muḥammad al-Ilāqī. Shams al-Dīn was very ambitious, of a supremely pleasant disposition,
            exceedingly intelligent and highly dedicated. He distinguished himself in the sciences,
            had a profound knowledge of philosophy and medicine, was adept in research and skillful
            in debate. He was considered a leading scholar, and had an academy where he taught

            son of the leading physician Shams al-Dīn Muḥammad b. ʿAbdān b. ʿAbd al-Wāhid, was
            unique in the medical art, a wonder in philosophy, keen-witted, most eloquent, devoted
            to the sciences and well-versed in the literary disciplines. He surpassed the ancients
            in philosophy and Sahbān Wā'il in rhetoric. He composed astonishing poetry and eloquent
            epistles. Even Labīd did not reach the standard of his poetry, and ʿAbd al-Hamīd did not
            equal him in correspondence. "When I saw people inferior to him, I realized that fate
            was against them."</p>
          <p>Najm al-Dīn was born in Aleppo in 607/ 1210. When his father went to Damascus, he took
            this son, then only a child, along with him. Najm al-Dīn's merits and high-flown
            ambition were apparent already in his youth. He studied medicine under Muhadhdhab al-Dīn
            ʿAbd al-Raḥīm ʿAlī. He later continued his studies and distinguished himself in the
            sciences until he became an outstanding savant. He served al-Malik al-Mansūr Ibrāhīm b.
            al-Malik al-Mujāhib b. Asad al-Dīn Sirkūh b. Jadī, the Governor of Homs, and therefore
            took up residence in that city. This potentate placed the utmost confidence in his
            medical art and raised him higher and higher, until he made him vizier and chief judge.
            When al-Malik al-Mansūr died — may God have mercy upon him — in 643/1245, after subduing
            the Khawārizms, Najm al-Dīn joined al-Malik al-Sālih Najm al-Dīn Ayyūb b. al-Malik
            al-Kāmil in Egypt. The ruler honored him greatly, lavished gifts on him and placed him
            in charge of the Dīwān in Alexandria, allotting him three thousand dirhams <pb n="834"
              ed="kopf"/> monthly. Najm al-Dīn stayed there for a while and then returned to Syria
            and became Dīwān Minister for the whole of the Syrian province.</p>
          <p>His epistles include a note which describes the task of the servant — may Allāh prolong

            purpose of the State's existence (may Allāh make the State eternal). Whatever the master
            commands, the servant must do, knowing that opportunity passes like the clouds, so that
            no delay is permissible. The master knows the order in which things must be done, and
            the servant is like an arrow which the master aims or a sword which he unsheathes, God
            helps those who are prompt and speedy and soon shows them signs of success and victory.
            But, one must beware of decay and neglect, for these spell ruin. God is our support in
            time of need, when we ask him to fulfill our desires; and our wish is that he encourage

          <p> The illustrious imām and distinguished scholar, Zain al-Dīn Sulaymān b. al-Mu'ayyad
            ʿAlī, the son the preacher of ʿAqrabā', studied medicine under Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd
            al-Raḥīm b. ʿAlī, may God have mercy upon him. He was well-versed in its theory and
            practice and thoroughly acquainted with both its generalia and specialia. He was
            physician to al-Malik al-Hāfiz Nūr al-Dīn Arslān Shāh b. Abū Bakr b. Ayyūb, then
            governor of the fortress of Jaʿbar. He stayed there in his service and became prominent.
            This ruler honored him greatly, gave him a high position in his state and relied on him
            in all matters. Zain al-Dīn was interested in literature and poetry and also in
            calligraphy. He was, moreover adept in military matters and had free access to his
            master's sons, who favored him and allowed him considerable influence in their states.
            When al-Malik al-Hāfiz died, the fortress of Jaʿbar was transferred to al-Malil al-Nāsir
            Yūsuf b. Muḥammad b. Ghāzī, the Governor of Aleppo, by way of an exchange of letters, in
            which Zain al-Dīn took part. Zain al-Dīn then moved to Aleppo and gained considerable
            influence over al-Malik al-Nasir, with whom he held a high position. He married his
            daughter, and thus acquired great wealth. When al-Malik al-Nāsir conquered Damascus,
            Zain al-Dīn accompanied him there and became one of the leading figures in his state. He
            devoted himself to military and governmental matters as well as to medicine. With this
            in mind I composed the following lines about him: </p>
          <quote><p><l>Zain al-Dīn holds every fine position; his rank is supreme in the heavens of
                praise: <pb n="837" ed="kopf"/>
              </l><l> A prince endowed with universal knowledge, whose intellect and experience are
                peerless; </l><l> As a physician he presides over councils, as a warrior he defeats
                squadrons, </l><l> In time of peace he revives many who rely on his skill, </l><l>
                In time of war he annihilates many with his sword.</l></p></quote>
          <p>He stayed in Damascus with al-Malik al-Nāsīr until Tatar messengers came to the latter
            from the East, demanding that he hand over his kingdom or come to terms by paying
            tribute, etc. Zain al-Dīn al-Hāfizr was sent as a messenger to Khāqān Hūlāgu, the Tatar
            king, and the other Tatar rulers. They treated him well and gave him money, until he
            became like one of them and mixed freely with them, He went back and forth as a
            messenger many times, encouraging the Tatars to attack the State, and warning al-Malik
            al-Nāsir that they were powerful, extremely dangerous, and their organization excellent.
            He described their great armies and disparaged al-Malik al-Nāsir and his armies. But
            al-Malik al-Nāsir was bold and determined to fight. The Tatars appeared before Aleppo,
            with Hulāgū at their head, besieged the city for about a month, and finally conquered
            it. They killed the men, took the women and children captive, plundered the city's
            wealth and destroyed the fortress and other buildings. Al-Malik al-Nāsir Yūsuf fled from
            Damascus to Egypt, intending to conquer the land, but the Egyptian armies, with al-Malik
            al-Muzaffar Saif al-Dīn Qutuz at their head, defeated him so utterly that his armies
            were routed and his kingdom came to an end. The Tatars gained possession of Damascus by
            treaty and installed there a governor friendly to them. Zain al-Dīn remained there also.
            He was made a prince, and a group of soldiers always accompanied him, so that he became
            nicknamed "King Zain al-Dīn." <pb n="838" ed="kopf"/> When al-Malik al-Muzaffar Qutuz,
            the ruler of Egypt, arrived with the armies of Islam and inflicted upon the Tatars the
            famous crucial defeat at Wadī Kanan, killing huge numbers of them, their governor in
            Damascus and his relatives fled, and Zain al-Dīn al-Hāfizī went with them, for fear of
            losing his life at the hands of the Muslims. Syria returned to its former state, praise
            be to God, and after al-Malik al-Muzaffar Qutuz, may God have mercy upon him, it was
            ruled by al-Malik al-Zāhir Rukn al-Dīn Baibars, who became Sultan of both Egypt and
            Syria, may Allāh make his rule eternal.</p>

          <head><persName>Abū al-Fadl b. ʿAbd al-Karīm the Geometer.</persName></head>
          <p> Mu'ayyad al-Dīn Abū al-Fadl Muḥammad b. ʿAbd al-Karīm b. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Hāritī was
            born and brought up in Damascus. He was known as "the Geometer" because of his profound
            knowledge of geometry, for which he was famous before devoting himself to medicine. At
            first, he was a carpenter and stone-cutter, and earned his living by carpentry. He was
            much sought after, and most of the doors of the great hospital built by al-Malik
            al-ʿAdil Nūr al-Dīn b. Zankī, may God have mercy upon him, are his handiwork. I heard
            this from Sadīd al-Dīn b. Ruqaiqa, who heard it from Abū al-Fadl himself.</p>
          <p>Shams al-Dīn b. al-Mitwā', the oculist, was a great friend of his. He told me in his
            name that his acquaintance with the sciences come about in this way. He wanted to know
            Euclid in order to improve his carpentry, perfect its details and increase his output.
            In those days he worked at the Mosque of Matūn, below the little spring just west of
            Damascus. Each morning before going to work, he learnt a passage of Euclid's book by
            heart. Moreover, he solved some problems from it on the way and after work, until he had
            studied the whole book, understood it thoroughly and was familiar with it. He then
            studied the Almagest and solved the problems <pb n="839" ed="kopf"/> contained therein,
            and finally he devoted himself entirely to geometry and became very proficient in
            it.</p>
          <p>Ibn Aba Usaybiʿah continues: Abū al-Fadl concerned himself also with astronomy and drew
            up astronomical tables. At that time, al-Sharaf of Tūs, a man matchless in his
            generation in geometry and the exact sciences, arrived in Damascus. Abū al-Fadl met him,
            studied under him and learnt a great deal from him. He studied medicine under Abū
            al-Majd Muḥammad b. Abū al-Hakam, staying with him for a long period. He also copied
            many philosophical and medical books. I have found a copy of Galen's "Sixteen Books,"
            with Abū al-Majd's notes on them which Abū al-Fadl made after studying that work with
            the latter. It was Abū al-Fadl who repaired the clocks of the Mosque of Damascus. He
            supervised and maintained them, for which he received a regular salary. He was given
            another salary for his work as a physician at the great hospital, which work he carried
            on for many years, in fact, until his death. He was a good physician, a quick and
            skilled therapeutist. He traveled to Egypt in 572-3/1176-7 and gained some knowledge of
            the Alexandrian tradition from Rashīd al-Dīn Abū al-Tanā' Hamād b. Hibat Allāh b. Hamād
            b. al-Findoul al-Harānī and Abū Tahr Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. Ibrāhīm
            al-Salafī al-Isfahānī. He also studied literature and grammar and wrote poetry marked by
            pleasant rhythm. He died of diarrhea in Damascus in 599/1201, may God have mercy upon
            him, around the age of seventy. The following is a specimen of his poetry, copied by me
            from his manuscript of the "Treatise on the Vision of the New Moon," which he wrote in
            honor of the Judge Muhyi al-Dīn, the son of the Judge Zaki al-Dīn . . . . . . . . . .

          <p>He at first studied at Aminiyyah University, which was near the Damascus Mosque. Later
            he went on to study medicine under Ilyās b. al-Mutrān until be became an expert in both

            whose example everyone followed. He maintained a consulting office for his medical
            students, and served as physician at the Great Hospital founded by al-Malik al-Ādil Nūr
            al-Dīn. He then attended al-Malik al-Ādil Abū Bakr b. Ayyūb for many years and received
            from him gifts and favors, a high position and a generous salary. He stayed in his
            service until he died of colic in Damascus — may God have mercy upon him — on Friday the
            20th of Dhū al-Qaʿdah, 604/1207. He was buried on Mount Qāsiyūn. As he was born in

          <p> The glorious physician and learned imām, Saʿd al-Dīn Abū Isḥāq Ibrāhīm b. ʿAbd
            al-ʿAzīz b. ʿAbd al-Jabbār b. Abū Muḥammad al-Sulamī, resembled his father in character,
            knowledge and skill. He was very religious, adept in the different branches of law and
            theology. When he was in Damascus, he would pray in seclusion at the mosque during the
            whole of Ramadan, not talking to anybody. He was placed in charge of the construction of
            Hanbaliyya University, in the flour market in Damascus, during the reign of al-Malik
            al-Asraf Mūsā b. al-Malik al-ʿAdil, after the Caliph of Baghdād, the Imām al-Mustansir
            bi-Allāh, had ordered it to be built. Saʿd al-Dīn was unique in his day in the field of
            medicine. He was thoroughly familiar with its general principles and its different
            specialized branches, but even so continued to study it whatever the circumstances. Born
            in Damascus at the beginning of Muharram, 583/1187, he became a physician at the Great
            Hospital founded by al-Malik al- ʿAdil. He then served al-Malik al-Ashraf Abū al-Fath
            Mūsā b. Abū Bakr b. Ayyūb, staying with him in the East and receiving many gifts from
            him, in addition to a large salary and an important official position. He was still in
            al-Malik al-Ashraf's service when the latter came to Damascus and the city was handed
            over to him by his nephew, al-Malik al-Nāsir Dā'ūd b. al-Malik al-Muʿazzam, in Shaʿbān,
            626/1229. He accompanied the Sultan to Damascus and settled there. Later the Sultan made
            him chief physician, in which post he continued until the Sultan passed away — may God
            have mercy upon him — in the citadel of Damascus in the early hours of the morning of
            Thursday, the 11th of Muharram, 635/1237. Damascus was conquered by al-Malik al-Kāmil
            Muḥammad b. Abū Bakr b. Ayyūb in the first ten days of Jumāda I, 635/1237. That ruler
            asked Saʿd al-Dīn to continue in office and ordered all the benefits <pb n="842"
              ed="kopf"/> accorded him by his brother, al-Malik al-Ashraf, to be reconfirmed. Saʿad
            al-Dīn served him for a very short while, for al-Malik al-Kāmil died — may God have
            mercy upon him — in the early evening of Thursday, the 22nd of Rajab, 635/1237. Sa'd
            al-Dīn remained in Damascus, maintaining a general consulting office for all his medical
            students, until he died in Jumāda II, 644/1246. Al-Sarif al-Bakrī wrote a verse in Saʿd

          <head><persName>Radiyy al-Dīn of Rahbī.</persName></head>
          <p> The learned imam, Radiyy al-Dīn Abū al-Hajjāj Yūsuf b. Haidara b. al-Ḥasan al-Rahbī
            was a prominent physician. He was extolled both by the elite and the common people and
            honored by kings and others. He was wise and generous, truthful and honest, a lover of
            goodness and the good. He exerted himself tirelessly in visiting the sick, feeling
            compassion toward them. He was pure of speech, and there was no-one who could say that
            he had ever harmed or offended anybody. His father was from al-Hahbah; he too, was a
            good physician and an even better oculist. Kadiyy al-Dīn was born and bred in Jazīrat b.
            ʿUmar, and then lived for a while at Nisivī and al-Rahba. He traveled to Baghdad and
            other places, practicing medicine and becoming expert in it. In Egypt he met the Shaykh
            Muwaffaq al-Dīn, known as Ibn Jumaiʿ the Egyptian, and studied under him. He arrived
            with his father in Damascus in 555/1160, during the reign of the Sultan al-Malik
            al-ʿAdil Nūr al-Dīn Maḥmūd b. Zanghī. When they had been there tor several years, his
            father died and was buried on Mount Qāsiyun. Radiyy al-Dīn remained in Damascus, keeping
            office for the treatment of the sick; he wrote many books there. After a time, while
            continuing on the same occupation, he studied under Muhadhdhab al-Dīn b. al-Naqqash the
            Physician, through whom he became so well known <pb n="843" ed="kopf"/> that he met
            al-Malik al-Nāsir Salāh al-Dīn Yūsuf b. Ayyūb. This ruler was pleased with him, allotted
            him a fixed monthly salary of thirty dinars and attached him to the citadel and the
            hospital. He remained in this position during the whole reign of Salāh al-Dīn but
            refused to concede to the ruler's request that he attend him on journeys. When Salāh
            al-Dīn died — may God have mercy upon him — in Damascus during the first watch of the
            night of Wednesday, the 27th of Safar 589/1193, and the kingdom passed from his sons to
            his brother, al-Malik al ʿĀdil Abū Bakr b. Ayyūb, the later ordered Radiyy al- Dīn to
            serve him as long as his health permitted, but he refused. He asked to be posted to
            Damascus, and al-Malik al-'Ādil granted his request and reconfirmed all the emoluments
            drawn by him in the days of Salāh al-Dīn. He continued his former activities until the
            death of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil. That ruler was succeeded by al-Malik al-Muʿassam ʿĪsā b.
            al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, who employed him as a visiting physician at the hospital for fifteen
            dinars. He continued to work there up to his death, may God bless him. He taught
            medicine to many students, many of whom became prominent. These in turn instructed
            others, becoming leading masters of the art. If one were to review the physicians of
            Syria, one would find that all of them studied under either al-Rahbī himself or his
            disciples. Among his students at the beginning of his career was the Shaykh Muhadhdhab
            al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm b. ʿAlī, who afterwards studied under Ibn al-Mūtrān.</p>
          <p>The Shaykh Radiyy al-Dīn told me himself that those who had studied with him had all
            later helped and benefited the people. He named many who were prominent in the medical
            profession, some already dead. He made it a rule never to teach any medical principle to
            Christians or Jews or to persons who were not worthy of it, for he hold the profession
            in high honor and esteem. He told me that all his life he had never taught Jews or
            Christians, except two — <pb n="844" ed="kopf"/> ʿImran al-ʿIsrā'īlī and Ibrāhīm b.
            Khalaf the Samaritan — and these only out of compassion after they had begged and
            pleaded with him, giving reasons that he could not disregard. Indeed, both became
            distinguished physicians.</p>
          <p>There is no doubt that some teachers bring good luck to those who study with their
            help, just as some books in the different sciences prove valuable while others do not. I
            myself studied a medical book with him in 622-3/1225-6, especially its practical part
            (by Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. Zakariyyā al-Razī and others), and indeed benefited a great
            deal by it.</p>
          <p>Al-Rahbī loved his profession and was devoted to it, at the same time taking care to
            preserve his health and good humor. ʿAlī Sahib Jamāl al-Dīn Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. Yūsuf
            b. Ibrāhīm al-Qiftī told me in the name of al-Rahbī himself that he followed the
            ordinary rules of health at all times. I have heard that he employed the best cooks and
            taught them the rules which seemed most beneficial to him, so that they might apply them
            to the food he wished to eat. When the cooking was successfully completed, the cook
            would inform al-Rahbī and he would inquire which of his friends would be his table
            companions. When they arrived, the cook would ask whether he might serve the food, but
            he would tell her to wait until their appetite was ready, when they would call her and
            order her to serve quickly. Only then would he eat. One day, one of his friends asked
            him the reason for this habit. He answered: "Eating with appetite is essential for
            preserving health, for when the members of the body want compensation for what they have
            spent, they ask it of the stomach, and the stomach in turn summons it from the outside."
            — "What is the advantage?" — "It helps a man to attain his natural life-span." — "But
            you have lived to an age which is little short of that, so why go to all this trouble?"
            — "In order that <pb n="845" ed="kopf"/> during this brief period I may stay above
            ground — breathing the air and drinking water — instead of underground because of a
            faulty diet." He continued to follow these principles until his time came.</p>
          <p>Ibn Abū Usaybiʿah continues: I have had an experience similar to that mentioned above,
            concerning the fact that one should not eat except with an appetite. One day, I was
            studying with him a passage in al-Rāzī on the order of taking food. Al-Rāzī says that a
            man should eat twice on one day and then once on the following day. Al-Rahbī commented:
            "Do not follow this principle, but eat whenever you have a real appetite, no matter if
            it is once or twice, day or night; for it is eating with a true appetite that benefits
            the body, while the opposite is harmful." He acted accordingly, and also followed other
            principles all his life, without a single deviation. For instance, Saturday was the day
            on which he would go to the garden to rest, the day of leisure; Thursday was the day on
            which he took a hot bath; on Fridays he used to visit all the chiefs and notables he had
            to see; furthermore, he always insisted that he would not climb a ladder, or even go
            near one, describing the ladder as "the saw which cuts off life."</p>
          <p>One of the best anecdotes in this connection is the one he told my father: "Since I
            bought the house in which I live, more than twenty-five years ago, I do not remember
            going up to the attic. I have never been up there, since I looked over the house
            previous to buying it."</p>
          <p>As to his efficiency as a therapeutist, al-Sāhib Safiyy al-Dīn Ibrāhīm b. Marzūq, the
            vizier of al-Malik al-Ashraf b. al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, told me the following: Al-Sāhib Saiyy
            al-Dīn b. Shukr, the vizier of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, always ate poultry, never mutton. One
            day, he complained to al-Rahbī about his pale complexion, for which physicians had
            unsuccessfully treated him with liquid and other medicines. Al-Rahbī went out and
            presently returned with a piece <pb n="846" ed="kopf"/> of chicken breast and a piece of
            red mutton, 'saying: "You are accustomed to eat fowl but the blood produced by it in the
            body is not of the same redness as that produced by the meat of sheep, just at the color
            of this meat differs greatly from that of poultry. You should give up fowl and keep to
            mutton. This will cure you without further treatment." The vizier followed al-Rahbī's
            advice for a while, whereupon his color returned and the balance of his humors was
            restored.</p>
          <p>Ibn Abū Usaybiʿah adds: "This treatment I recommend to everybody interested in a
            revigorating and healthy diet. The vizier, a man of perfect build, had a robust
            constitution and good digestion, only that the blood he obtained from fowl's meat was
            too weak; he needed richer and coarser food. When he went over to mutton, he produced
            blood sufficiently strong for the requirements of his body, so that his humors became
            balanced and his color normal."</p>
          <p>Shaykh Radiyy al-Dīn al-Rahbī was born in Jumādā I, 534/1139, in Jazfrat b. ʿUmar. His
            last illness broke out on the Feast of Sacrifice in the year 630/1232. He died, may God
            have mercy upon him, on the morning of Sunday, the 10th of Muharram, 631/1233, in
            Damascus, and he was buried on Mount Qāsiyūn. He lived about a hundred years without any
            noticeable deterioration in his hearing or sight; only in his last years did he suffer
            from loss of memory in respect of recent experiences, but as for things he had known for
            a long time, he remembered them well. He had two sons; the elder was Sharaf al-Dīn Abū
            al-Ḥasan ʿAlī, the younger Jamāl al-Dīn ʿUthmān. A member of his family who was with him
            during his last illness told me that in his final moments he kept his right hand on the
            pulse in his left wrist until he felt his strength ebbing; he then clapped his hands,
            straightened his cap and waited for death, which came soon. <pb n="847" ed="kopf"/>

          <p> The distinguished physician and learned imām, Sharaf al-Dīn Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. Yūsuf
            b. Haidara b. al-Ḥasan al-Rahbī, unique in his generation, was born in Damascus in the
            year 583/1187. He followed in his father's footsteps, just as he resembled him in
            appearance, character and behavior. He applied himself to the study of books, while his
            soul was forever seeking to acquire virtue. He thoroughly mastered medicine both in its
            general principles and its details. He wrote books on medicine, and annotated medical
            works written by others. He studied medicine with his father and with Shaykh Muwaffaq
            al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Latīf b. Yūsuf, of Baghdād, under whose direction he copied many
            scientific books, especially the works of Muwaffaq al-Dīn himself. He also studied
            literature with Shaykh 'Alam al-Dīn al-Sakhāwī and other scholars, until his knowledge
            could not be bettered. He was also a skilled poet, but most of all liked to study the
            books of the ancients. He was pure and dignified and did not like to have recourse to
            kings and notables. He worked for a while at the Great Hospital founded by al-Malik
            al-ʿAdil Nūr al-Dīn b. Zankī. When our master Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm b. ʿAlī,
            may God have mercy upon him, turned his house in Damascus into a medical school, and
            benefited the Muslims by his teaching there, he appointed Sharaf al-Dīn b. al-Rahbī to
            be professor there in view of his extraordinary knowledge and insight. He taught there
            for a while and then died, may God have mercy upon him, in Damascus, and was buried on
              <pb n="848" ed="kopf"/> Mount Qāsiyūn. He died of pleurisy on the night of Thursday,
            the 11th of Muharram, 667/1267. The physician Badr al Dīn, the son of the judge of
            Baʿalbekk, and Shams al-Dīn al-Kutubī, known as al-Khawātīmī, told me that months before
            he fell ill and died Sharaf al-Dīh had told visitors and students that he would die
            soon, at the conjunction of the two stars; he had asked them to tell this to the people
            so that they might know the measure of his knowledge of life and death.</p>
          <p>The following are specimens of his poetry which I heard from him personally . . . . . .
            . . . . [a long poem and two short ones about the meaning of death.]</p>
          <p>This poem, he recited to me when al-Malik al-Kāmil Muḥammad b. Abī Bakr b. Ayyūb died
            in Damascus in 635/1237 . . . . . . . . . .</p>
          <p>The next poem he recited to me after the death of his brother, the physician Jamāl
            al-Dīn ʿUthmān in 658/ 1258 . . . . . . . . . .</p>
          <p>He used to dye his hair with henna, upon which I remarked, "If you left your beard
            white, it would be more becoming''; he thus recited extempore . . . . . . . . . .</p>
          <p>The next is an extract from a letter he wrote to me from Damascus when I was in Sarhad,
            staying with the local governor, Prince ʿIzz al-Dīn Aibak al-Muʿazzamī . . . . . . . . .

            it, traveling from time to time to Egypt to import goods from there. When the Tatars
            arrived in Syria in 657/ 1258, he went to Egypt and settled there. He then fell ill and
            died in Cairo on the 20th of Rabīʿ II, 658/1259.</p>

          <p> i.e., Muwaffak al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Latif al-Baghdādi. The Shaykh and illustrious Imām
            Muwaffak al-Dīn Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Latīf b. Yūsuf b. Muḥammad b. ʿAlī  b. Abī Saʿd,
            known as Ibn al-Labbād [The son of the feltmaker]. His family hailed from Mosul, but he
            himself was born in Baghdād. He became renowned for his knowledge of various sciences
            and his scholarship. He had a pleasant diction and wrote copiously, his special field
            being Arabic grammar and lexicology. He was also well-versed in Muslim theology and in
            medicine. While in Damascus, he devoted much of his time to the medical art and became
            renowned for his mastery of its theory. Numerous students and even physicians frequented
            him to study under his guidance. In his youth, his father had urged him to take lessons
            in the Hadith with a number of scholars, including Abū 'l-Fath Muḥammad b. ʿAbd al-Bāqī,
            known as Ibn al-Battī, Abū Zarʿah Tāhir b.  Muḥammad al-Maqdisī [of Jerusalem], Abū
            'l-Kasim Yaḥyā b. Thābit al-Wakīl and others.</p>
          <p>Shaykh Muwaffak al-Dīn's father, Yūsuf, was himself a student of the Hadīth, a
            brilliant scholar in Qur'ānic subjects, including the <pb n="850" ed="kopf"/> variant
            readings, and an excellent authority on Shiʿite tenets, on the differences between the
            various schools of Muḥammadan law and on the theoretical foundations of both Muslim
            theology and law. In addition, he had some knowledge of the speculative sciences (in
            contradistinction to the religious disciplines, which are largely dependent upon
            tradition). Shaykh Muwaffak al-Dīn's paternal uncle, Sulaimān, was an excellent
            jurist.</p>
          <p>Shaykh Muwaffak al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Latīf was a highly industrious person. He never let a
            moment pass without reading, writing or copying. I have seen countless books written in
            his hand, for he used to make several copies of his own works and copied numerous books
            of earlier authors. He was a friend of my grandfather's, and the two men kept close
            company when they lived in Egypt.</p>
          <p>Both my father and my paternal uncle studied belles-lettres under him. My uncle also
            studied Aristotle with him, for Shaykh Muwaffak was greatly interested in his works and
            was anxious to understand them.</p>
          <p>When he had moved from Egypt to Damascus and was staying there for a time, the
            townspeople derived much benefit from his learning. I saw him when he lived in Damascus,
            on the occasion of my last visit to the city. He was a lean old man of medium height, a
            pleasant conversationalist with a beautiful diction; still, his written word was even
            more impressive than his speech. However, his conceit sometimes led him to go beyond the
            bound of good taste in his utterances. He used to deride his learned contemporaries and
            also many savants of earlier generations. He very often disparaged the Persian scholars
            and their writings, especially the Grand Master Ibn Sīnā and others of like
            standing.</p>
          <p>From a copy of his autobiography, written by his own hand, I quote the following: <pb
              n="851" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>

          <p>"I was born in the year 557 in a house belonging to my grandfather in al-Fālūdhaj Road.
            While receiving my education from Shaykh Abū al-Najīb, I knew neither leisure nor
            amusement. Most of my time was devoted to lessons in the Hadīth. After I had received
            authorizations from professors in Baghdād, Khurāsān, Syria and Egypt, my father said to
            me one day: 'I have had you study with all the luminaries of Baghdād, and now you are,
            as regards knowledge of the Hadīth, on a par with the old Shaykhs.' At the same time, I 
            had also studied calligraphy and learnt the Qur'ān [Thaʿlab's] Fasīh, the Maqāmas [of
            al-Harīrī|], the poetry of al-Mutanabbī and others, a compendium of jurisprudence and a
            compendium of grammar all by heart. When I reached puberty, my father took me to Kamāl
            al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al -Anbārī, who was at that time the greatest scholar in Baghdād.
            A friendship of long standing connected him with my father — from their student days at
            al-Nizamīyyah College. When I studied the Introduction to the Fasīh, with him, he
            uttered a long discourse of which I understood nothing but which the pupils round him
            admired very much. Then he said: 'I loathe teaching boys. Take him to my pupil al-Wajīh
            al-Wāsitī, that he may study under him. When he is older, he may study with me.'
            Al-Wajīh was the tutor of a son of Raʿīs al-Ruʿasaʿ. He was blind, but a rich and
            virtuous man. He received me cordially and started teaching me from dawn till sunset
            with great devotion. I attended his study circle in the Zafariyya Mosque, where he told
            me to read up on the commentaries, and talked to me about them. Eventually, I would read
            my lesson, and he would grant me the privilege of explaining it. Then we would leave the
            mosque. On the way, he would talk to me, and when we reached his house, he would take
            out the books that he was studying, and I would listen to him read his lesson and learn
            it by heart with him. Thereafter we would go to see Shaykh Kamal al-Dīn, and he would
            say his lesson <pb n="852" ed="kopf"/> and explain it while I listened. In this way I
            made so much progress that I eventually surpassed him in both knowledge and
            understanding. The greater part of the night I spent in learning by heart and repeating.
            We continued thus for some time. While I frequented teachers and teachers of teachers,
            my knowledge increased and improved continually, my grasp was enhanced, and my mind
            became more acute and balanced. The first work I studied thoroughly was "al-Lumaʿ" I
            mastered it within eight months, hearing every day a commentary on the bulk of it read
            by some of my fellow-students and, on returning home, reading myself the "Commentary of
            the Eighty," the commentaries of al-Sharīf ʿUmar b. Hamza and b. Burhān and any other
            commentary on that work which I could lay my hands on. Later I expounded them to other
            students who were among my closest friends and eventually I was able to discourse upon
            each chapter of the work at such length that I might have filled several copybooks
            without exhausting my knowledge. I then thoroughly studied Ibn Qutaibas' "Adab
            al-Kātib," the first half in several months and [the other half, entitled] Taqwīm
            al-Lisān in fourteen days, for it comprised fourteen quires. Afterwards I studied two
            works by the same author, "Mushkil al-Qur'ān," both in a very short time. Next I turned
            to Abū ʿAlī al-Fārisi's "al-Idāh," which took me many months to digest. I constantly
            read the commentaries on it and scrutinized the work itself in the most painstaking way,
            until I acquired complete mastery of it and became fully acquainted with the remarks of
            the commentators. As to the "Takmila," I studied it in a few days, a quire a day. I used
            to read both extensive works and compendia, devoting myself, for example, to
            al-Mubarrad's "Muqtadab" and Ibn Durustawaihi's book. At the same time, I never
            neglected my lectures on the Hadith and my law studies under my teacher Ibn Fudlān in
            Dar al-Dhahab, a college built by Fakhr al-Dawlah b. al-Muttalib. <pb n="853" ed="kopf"
            />
          </p>
          <p>"Shaykh Kamal al-Dīn wrote 130 works, most of them on grammar and some on law, on the
            principles of Muslim law and theology, on mysticism and on ascetism. I mastered most of
            his writings through lectures, reading and self-tuition. He had begun to write two large
            works, one on lexicology and the other on law, but was not fortunate enought to be able
            to complete them. Under his guidance I studied part of Sibawaihi's "Kitāb" and devoted
            myself to "al-Muqtadab," which I came to master thoroughly.</p>
          <p>"After the death of the Shaykh, I occupied myself entirely with Sibawaihi's "Kitāb" and
            its commentary by al-Sirafi. Later, I studied a great number of works under b. ʿUbaida
            al-Karkhī, among others the "K. al-'Usūl" of Ibn al-Sarraj, a copy of which was found in
            the waqf [endowment] established by Ibn al-Khashshāb in the al-Ma'munīyyah Hospice. I
            also studied with him two works of al-Khatīb al-Tibrīzī, one on the law of inheritance
            and the other on prosody. Al-Tibrīzī was one of the outstanding disciples of Ibn
            al-Shajarī. As for Ibn al-Khashshāb, I happened to listen to a lecture of his on
            al-Zajjaj's [Qur'anic commentary entitled] "Maʿāni" [al-Qur'ān], while he was teaching
            Shuhda the secretary, the daughter of al-Ibrī. I also heard from him the following
            hadīth: 'Those who have mercy will be treated mercifully by the Merciful. Show mercy to
            those on earth, and you will be shown mercy by Him who is in heaven.'"</p>
          <p>Muwaffaq al-Dīn al-Baghdādī further reports that among the teachers from whom he
            derived great benefit — as he expressly states — was the son of 'Amīn al-Dawlah b. al
            Tilmīdh. He speaks ot him at length and in glowing terms, obviously on account of his
            strong bias in favor of the Iraqis; for the son of Amīn al-Dawlah was not in the least
            worthy of such praise.</p>
          <p>Muwaffaq al-Dīn proceeds to say: "There came to Baghdād a man from the Maghrib, tall,
            dressed in the garb of a mystic, of impressive bearing, with an eloquent tongue and a
            pleasing appearance; <pb n="854" ed="kopf"/> he had an air of piety and the look of an
            itinerant dervish. All who saw him were impressed by his exterior even before getting to
            know him. His name was Ibn Tātilī and he claimed descent from the veil-wearers. He had
            left the Maghrib when ʿAbd al-Muʿmin made himself master of that region. When he had
            settled in Baghdād, a number of great scholars and notables frequented him, among them
            al-Radī al-Qazwini and Shaykh al-Shuyukh b. Sakina. I, too, was one of those who
            cultivated his acquaintance. He taught me the elements of arithmetic and the
            "Introduction to Grammar" by Ibn Babshādh. He had a wonderful way of teaching, and all
            who came to see him thought him a great authority. Actually, he possessed only
            superficial knowledge. But he had thoroughly acquainted himself with works on alchemy,
            talismans and similar subjects. He had studied all the works of Jābir and Ibn
            Wahshiyyah. With his appearance, his speech and his imposing manner he charmed all
            hearts. My own he filled with a passion for all the sciences. When he came in contact
            with the ʿImām al-Nāsir li-Dīn Allāh, he inspired the latter's admiration.</p>
          <p>After he had left, I devoted myself to study with the greatest zeal, shunning both
            sleep and amusement. I applied myself eagerly to the works of al-Ghazzālī, such as
            "al-Maqasid," "al-Miʿyar," "al-Mizān" and "Mihakk al-Nazzār," and later turned to the
            works of b. Sīnā, from the minor ones to the weighty volumes. I learned the "Kitāb
            al-Nagā"by heart; I copied and pondered the "Shifā." I also studied the "Kitab
            al-Tahsīl" by Bahmanyār, Ibn Sīnā's disciple. In addition, I copied and studied many of
            the works of Jābir b. Hayyan al-Sufi and Ibn Wahshiyyah and engaged in the futile art of
            misleading experiments [of alchemy]. The author who led me further astray was Ibn Sīnā
            by his greatest philosophical work, which he did not complete. <pb n="855" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>"In the year 585/1189, when no one was left in Baghdād apt to capture my heart, arouse
            my admiration and solve the problems I encountered, I moved to Mosul; but there, too, I
            found no satisfaction of my desires. Al-Kamāl b. Yūnus, it is true, was good in
            mathematics and law, but amateurish in the other philosophical disciplines. His mind and
            time were absorbed by his interest in alchemy and the exercise of this art, with the
            result that he despised all others. I came in contact with many people, and a number of
            positions were offered to me, out of which I chose a post at the College of Ibn Muhājir
            and the Hadīth School attached to it.</p>
          <p>"I stayed in Mosul for one year, kept busy all the time, by day and night. The people
            of the town asserted that they had never seen anyone so erudite, quick-witted and
            self-possessed as I. I heard people make much of the philosopher Shihāb al-Dīn
            al-Suhrawardi, whom they believed to surpass both the Ancients and the Moderns and whose
            writings they ranked above those of his predecessors. I had long intended to find out
            the truth, until the opportunity at last presented itself. I borrowed some of
            al-Suhrawardi's writings from b. Yūnus, who himself held them in high esteem. On
            perusing "al-Talwihāt," "al-Lamha" and "al-Maʿārij," I came to the conclusion that my
            contemporaries were ignorant. I found a great number of annotations, which, though I was
            not satisfied with them, were better than the sayings of that fool. He introduced single
            letters into the text, with the intention of making people of his kind believe they were
            divine secrets.</p>
          <p>"On entering Damascus I found a great number of eminent scholars from Baghdād and
            elsewhere, who had been attracted by Salāh al-Dīn's liberality; they included Jamāl
            al-Dīn ʿAbd al -Latīf, the son of Shaykh Abū 'l-Najīb, the surviving members of Raʿis
            al-Ruʿasa's family, b. Talha the secretary, the household of b. Juhair, the vizier b.
            al-ʿAttār al-Maqtūl and the vizier Ibn Hubaira. I used <pb n="856" ed="kopf"/> to meet
            al-Kindī, the grammarian of Baghdād, and had many discussions with him. He was a
            handsome old man, sagacious, wealthy, and a favorite of the Sultan. However, he was very
            conceited and rude. In the arguments we had, Allāh, the Most High, let me gain the upper
            hand of him on many occasions. Later, I used to avoid him, and this caused him greater
            mortification than people had to endure from him.</p>
          <p>"In Damascus I wrote a great number of works, among them the large [dictionary of the
            Hadith] "Gharīb al-Hadīth," in which I combined the contents of three works with the
            same title by Abū ʿUbaid al-Qāsim b. Sallām, Ibn Qutaibah and al-Khattābī. I had already
            begun to compose it in Mosul. I also made an epitome of it, which I entitled
            "al-Mujarrad." In addition, I wrote the "Kitāb al-Wādihāl," on syntactical problems in
            the Fatihah [the first Sura of the Qur'ān], filling about twenty quires, the Kitab
            al-'Alif wal-Lām" [on the definite article], "K.Rubba" [on the use of the word "rubba"
            in grammar], and a book on "essence" and "essential attributes" — terms frequently used
            by the theologians; with the latter I intended to refute the opinions of al-Kindī.</p>
          <p>In Damascus I met Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh b. Tātilī, who resided in the western tunnel of the
            mosque. Hordes of pupils used to gather round him. People were divided into two factions
            with regard to him. His opponents included the preacher al-Dawlaī, a notable personality
            who enjoyed great prestige and respect. Ibn Tātili eventually committed a serious
            blunder, by which he helped his foes against himself. Embarking upon the study of
            alchemy and philosophy, he brought himself into disrepute. When I met him, he questioned
            me concerning various pursuits that I held to be mean and useless but which he
            considered important and worthwhile. On exploring his character and finding that he did
            not come up to my expectations, I formed a negative opinion of him and his way of life.
            Arguing with him on scholarly subjects, I discovered that he <pb n="857" ed="kopf"/>
            possessed but meager knowledge. One day I said to him: 'If the time you have wasted on
            alchemy had been devoted to some of the religious or secular disciplines, you would now
            be unique in your age and would have gained lifelong respect. This is the elixir (of
            happiness], — not what you are striving to attain. Contemplating his condition, I took
            warning from his sorry fate. Happy the man who learns from the experience of others. I
            withdrew from him — but not completely.</p>
          <p>"He later sought out Salāh al-Dīn on the outskirts of Acre and complained to him about
            al-Dawlaī. He returned sick and was admitted to hospital, where he died. His books were
            taken by al-Muʿtamid, head of the Damascus police, who had a passion for alchemy.</p>
          <p>"Afterwards I traveled to Jerusalem and then visited Salāh al-Dīn on the outskirts of
            Acre. There I met Bahā' al-Dīn b. Shaddād, then military judge, who had already heard of
            me in Mosul. He received me cordially and most hospitably. At his suggestion, we went to
            see the secretary ʿImād al-Dīn, whose tent was next to Bahā' al-Dīn's. I found him
            writing a letter to the High Divan, in Thulth-Script, without first making a draft. He
            told me the letter was to go to my town.</p>
          <p>"After conversing with me on certain theological problems, he suggested that we see
            al-Qādī al-Fādil. When we entered his room, I saw a lean old man of extremely spiritual
            appearance [literally who was nothing but head and heart]. He was writing and at the
            same time dictating to two scribes, while his face and lips went into all kinds of
            contortions owing to the great difficulty he had in articulating. He seemed to be
            writing with all his limbs. He asked me some syntactical questions with regard to two
            Qur'anic passages and numerous other questions, and all the time he never stopped
            writing and dictating. At last he said to me: 'Return to <pb n="858" ed="kopf"/>
            Damascus, and you will be granted a stipend.' When I replied that I intended to go to
            Egypt, he said: 'The Sultan is greatly concerned about the capture of Acre by the Franks
            and about the murder of the Muslims in the town.' Still I insisted that I had to go to
            Egypt. He thereupon made out a little paper for me, addressed to his representative in
            Egypt.</p>
          <p>"When I arrived in Cairo, his representative, Ibn Sanā' al-Mulk, came to call on me. He
            was an old man who enjoyed high prestige and great authority. He lodged me in a house
            which had been put in good repair and furnished me with money and provisions. He then
            went to the state dignitaries and informed them that I was the guest of al-Qādī
            al-Fādil, whereupon gifts and presents were showered upon me from all sides. Every ten
            days or so a memorandum from al-Qādī al-Fādil concerning state affairs arrived at the
            Egyptian government office; it always contained a passage reaffirming the recommendation
            to take care of me.</p>
          <p>"I used togive public lectures in the mosque of the chamberlain Lu'lu', may Allāh have
            mercy upon him. It had been my desire to meet three persons in Egypt: Yāsīn, the
            magician, the Chief Mūsā b. Māimūn, the Jew, and Abū 'l-Qāsim al-Shāriʿī; all of them
            came to call on me. Yāsīn was an imposter, a liar and a juggler. He attested to
            al-Shājānīs competence in alchemy, and al-Shāgānī attested to Yāsīn's ability in magic.
            Al-Shaqani asserted that Yāsīn could perform miracles which even Moses, the sou of
            Amrām, would have been unable to perform, that he could produce gold coins whenever he
            wanted and in any quantity and any mintage he desired, and that he could turn the waters
            of the Nile into a tent, under which he and his colleagues would be able to sit.
            Nevertheless, he was destitute.</p>
          <p>"When Mūsā came to visit me, I found him a man of noble character, even though not
            perfect, since he was very keen on leadership and on serving the rulers of this world.
            He wrote a book <pb n="859" ed="kopf"/> on medicine, the subject matter of which he
            assembled from the SixteenBooks of Galen and from five other works. He imposed upon
            himself the rule not to change a word [of his sources] except certain conjunctions. But
            he merely transmitted excerpts of his choice. He also wrote a book for the Jews,
            entitled "Guide" [to the Perplexed], and pronounced a curse upon those who would copy it
            in other than Hebrew characters. On seeing a copy of it I found it to be an inferior
            book, which instead of strengthening the foundations of religious law and belief as its
            author believed, in fact undermined them.</p>
          <p>"One day, when I was at the mosque, surrounded by a large crowd, there appeared an old
            man in shabby clothes but with a radiant look and dignified bearing. Those present paid
            him reverence and offered him a place of honor. I was just finishing my lecture, and
            when the meeting broke up, the Imam of the mosque approached me and said: 'Do you know
            that old man? He is Abū 'l-Qāsim al-Shariʿī.' I immediately went over to embrace him and
            said: It is you that I have been looking for. I took him to my house, where we ate a
            meal and talked. I found him to be a person pleasing to both my heart and eye. His
            behavior was that of a scholar and a wise man, and his appearance did not belie this. He
            was content with few worldly delights and did not become obsessed with any of them, so
            as not to be distracted from the quest for knowledge. From that day on he came to see me
            often. I discovered that he was well acquainted with the works of the ancients and also
            with those of Abū Nasr al-Fārābi. I set no great store by any of these, for I believed
            that the whole of wisdom had been encompassed by Ibn Sīnā and was embodied in his
            writings. When we engaged in discussion, I displayed superior dialectics and rhetoric,
            while he surpassed me in marshalling proofs and in lucidity of presentation. Still, his
            arguments did not dispel my prejudices. He then provided me, one by one, with the works
            of Abū Nasr, <pb n="860" ed="kopf"/> Alexander and Themistius. In this way, he wore down
            my resistance, until I accepted his views, though not without reluctance. About that
            time the news was spreading that Salāh al-Dīn had concluded an armistice with the Franks
            and had re-entered Jerusalem. It therefore became incumbent upon me to visit him. So I
            took as many of the books of the ancients as I could carry and set out for Jerusalem.
            There I saw the mighty ruler, the object of admiration and love, near and yet so far,
            easy of access and ready to grant requests. His entourage endeavored to emulate him,
            vying with each other in doing good, as Allāh, the Most High, says [Qur'ān, XV, 47): We
            have removed any malice that may have been in their breast.</p>
          <p>"On the first night after my arrival I attended a large gathering of scholars who
            discussed various sciences while Salāh al-Dīn listened attentively. He also took part in
            the discussion, taking up the subject of building walls and digging trenches. As he was
            well-versed in the matter, he was able to put forward a number of interesting
            suggestions. At that time, he was concerned with rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and
            digging its trenches. He himself took part in the carrying stones on his shoulders, and
            all the people, the poor and the rich, the weak and the strong, followed his example,
            even ʿImād al-Dīn the secretary and al-Qādi al-Fādil. Salāh al-Dīn would set out for
            work on horseback before dawn, stay until noon and then return to his residence, where
            he took a meal and a rest. In the afternoon, he again rode to work and returned only
            when the torches were lit. He spent most of the night planning the work of the next day. </p>
          <p>"Salāh al-Dīn awarded me a monthly allowance of thirty dinars, to be paid by the
            administration of the Great Mosque in Damascus, and as his sons too, granted me payments
            as well, I had a fixed monthly income of one hundred dinars. <pb n="861" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>"On my return to Damascus, I assiduously applied myself to study and to public teaching
            at the Great Mosque. The more I delved into the works of the ancients, the more I came
            to like them and dislike the works of Ibn Sīnā. I began to realize that alchemy was a
            futile occupation. I found out under what circumstances it had been initiated, who had
            been its originator, and the fact that he had made false claims in pursuit of certain
            objectives. Thus I freed myself of two very serious errors, for which I owe double
            thanks to Allāh, praise be to him; for many people have been ruined by the works of Ibn
            Sīnā and by alchemy.</p>
          <p>"After Salāh al-Dīn had moved to Damascus, he went out one day to bid the pilgrims'
            caravan farewell. On his return, he became feverish. He was bled by someone who had no
            experience at all, whereupon his strength ebbed and he died after being ill for less
            than fourteen days. The people mourned him as if he had been a prophet. I have not heard
            of so much grief having been displayed at the passing of any other king; for he was
            beloved by all, the righteous and the wicked, Muslims and nonbelievers.</p>
          <p>"His sons and courtiers dispersed in all directions, although most of them went to
            Egypt on account of the fertility of that country and the liberality of its king.</p>
          <p>"Damascus was ruled by al-Malik al-ʿAfdal, Salāh al-Dīn's eldest son. I remained there
            until al-Malik al-ʿAzīz came with the Egyptian army and laid siege to his brother. But
            al-Malik al-ʿAzīz achieved nothing. Receiving an attack of colic, he retreated to Marj
            al-Safr, and when he had recovered, I set out to meet him. He permitted me to join him
            on his way back and granted me a pension from the treasury, more than sufficient to meet
            my needs. I became closely attached to Shaykh Abū 'l-Qāsim, who used to visit me morning
            and evening until his death. Once when he was seriously ill, suffering from his head to
            his flanks, I advised him to take medicine, but he retorted with two lines of poetry: 
              <pb n="862" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <quote><p><l>I am not going to chase away the birds from a tree. </l><l> The bitter fruits
                of which I know from long experience.</l></p></quote>
          <p>"And when I enquired about his pains, he again replied with a line: </p>
          <quote><p><l>No wound can inflict pain on a dead body.</l></p></quote>
          <p>"It was my habit at that time to give public lectures at the al-Azhar Mosque from early
            morning until about the fourth hour or noon. My lectures were attended by students of
            medicine and others. Toward evening, I returned to the mosque, when my audience was of a
            different makeup. At night, I used to study for myself. In this manner I continued until
            the death of al-Malik al-ʿAzīz. He had been a noble and courageous young man, modest and
            never unwilling to grant a request. In spite of his youth and vigor, he showed perfect
            restraint in both monetary and sexual matters."</p>
          <p>The author says: Thereafter Shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn stayed on in Cairo for a time,
            receiving stipends and grants from the sons of Salāh al-Dīn. Egypt was then visited by a
            dearth and an epidemic such as had never been borne before. On these events Muwaffaq
            al-Dīn wrote a book, in which he described most startling happenings that he had either
            seen himself or heard from eye witnesses. This book he entitled "The Book of Information
            and Consideration, on Things Seen and Events Witnessed in the Land of Egypt."</p>
          <p>Later, when the Sultan al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Saif al-Dīn Abū Bakr b. Ayyub made himself
            master of Egypt, the greater part of Syria and the East, and the sons of his brother
            al-Malik al-Nāsir Salāh al Dīn dispersed having been deprived of their possessions.
            Shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn moved to Jerusalem, where he stayed for a time. There, at al-Aksa
            Mosque he gave frequent lectures on various sciences and wrote numerous books. Later, in
            the year 604/1207 he went to Damascus, where he lodged at the al-ʿAziziyya College and
            took up teaching and study. He had many pupils, who studied <pb n="863" ed="kopf"/>
            various sciences with him. In Damascus he distinguished himself in the medical art and
            wrote copiously in this field. He now became known for his medical lore, whereas
            previously his fame had rested on his knowledge of grammar.</p>
          <p>After staying in Damascus for a time, where the people profited greatly by his
            learning, he traveled to Aleppo and thence to Asia Minor, where he stayed for many
            years. He was in the service of ʿAlā' al-Dīn Da'ūd b. Bahrām, the ruler of Erzanjān, at
            whose court he established himself in a very honorable position and from whom he
            received a generous salary and many favors. To him he dedicated a good many works. ʿAlā'
            al-Dīn was a man of high aspirations, modest and noble-hearted. He had studied several
            sciences. Muwaffaq al-Dīn remained in his service until the ruler of Erzerum, the Sultan
            Kayqbādh b. Kaykhsarū b. Qalaj Arslān conquered his kingdom. ʿAlā' al-Dīn was taken
            prisoner and was never heard of again.</p>
          <p>Shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn Abd al-Latīf continues: "On the seventeenth day of Dhū-al-Qaʿdah
            of the year 625/1228, I set out for Erzerum, and on the eleventh day of Safar of the
            year 626/1229, I returned to Erzanjan. In the middle of Rabīʿ I, I went to Kamākh, which
            I left for Dabarkī [?] in the month of Jumada I. In the month of Rajab I moved from
            there to Melitene. At the end of Ramadan, I left for Aleppo. After performing the rites
            of ʿId al-Fitr in al-Bahnasā, I entered Aleppo on Friday, the 9th of Shawwāl. I found
            the city's prosperity, amenities and welfare greatly enhanced by the excellent
            administration of the Atabeg Shihāb al-Dīn. The whole population was united in their
            love of him, because he ruled his subjects justly."</p>
          <p>Shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn settled in Aleppo, where he engaged in teaching and wrote many
            works. In Shihāb al-Dīn Tughril al-Khādim, the Atabeg of Aleppo, he found an excellent
            patron, so that he could <pb n="864" ed="kopf"/> devote himself to teaching medicine and
            other subjects. He would repair to the Great Mosque of Aleppo to lecture on the Hadīth
            and teach the Arabic language. He was always busy, giving much of his time to copying
            and writing. While he was in Aleppo I meant to go and visit him, but this plan did not
            materialize. His books and letters reached us constantly, and he even sent me some of
            his works written by his own hand. </p>
          <p>This is the text of a letter I wrote to him when he was in Aleppo. . . . . . . . . . . </p>
          <p>In the first letter that Shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Latīf sent to my father he
            wrote with reference to me: "The son of the son is more beloved than the son himself. So
            this Muwaffaq al-Dīn [honorific name of Ibn Abū Usaybiʿah], being the son of my son, is
            dearer to me than any other man. Since his earliest youth, his excellence has been
            evident to me." He extolled me still further and then continued: "If I were able to come
            to him, so that he might become my pupil, I would do it." Indeed, it had been his
            intention to come to Damascus and stay there, but later he conceived the idea of first
            making the pilgrimage and, traveling via Baghdād, of presenting some of his writings to
            the Caliph al-Mustansir bi-Allāh. After reaching Baghdād he fell ill and died, may Allāh
            have mercy upon him, on Sunday, the 12th of Muharram in the year 629/1232. He was buried
            in al-Wardiyya [Cemetery] near his father's grave. This happened after he had been
            absent from Baghdād for forty-five years. Allāh, the Most High, led him back to this
            town, where he met his death.</p>
          <p>Of the sayings of Muwaffaq al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Latīf al-Baghdādī, I quote the following from
            an autograph copy: <pb n="865" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>It befits you to call yourself to account every night when you go to sleep, to consider
            what good deeds you have performed that day and to thank God for them, and to consider
            what evil deeds you have committed and to ask God's forgiveness and not do them again.
            You should also make plans for doing good the next day and ask God to help you.</p>
          <p>I exhort you not to derive knowledge (merely) from books, even though you may believe
            in the power of your understanding. In every science you strive to acquire you ought to
            have recourse to teachers, and even though a teacher's knowledge may.be deficient,
            accept from him what he has to offer until you find a better solution. You should honor
            and revere your teacher, and if you are able to reward him with some of your worldly
            possessions, do so; if not, reward him with your praise. When studying a book, make
            every effort to learn it by heart and assimilate its contents. Imagine that the book is
            not there — you will then not be dependent on it and not regret its absence. When
            applying yourself to one book, beware of studying another at the same time, but devote
            to the first the time you intended to spend on a second. Also beware of studying two
            sciences at the time — devote to each science one year, two years, or whatever time God
            wills. When you have had enough of one science, you may proceed to another, but do not
            believe that once you have mastered a science, you have done enough; you have to
            cultivate it that it may grow and not diminish, and this is done by repetition and
            thinking. A beginner's task is to learn, memorize and debate with fellow students, while
            a scholar's duty is to devote himself to teaching and writing. When teaching or
            discussing a science, do not mingle it with another one, for each science is
            self-sufficient and autonomous. By having recourse to another science when dealing with
            a particular one you merely admit that your knowledge of the latter is imperfect. It is
            like falling back on a <pb n="866" ed="kopf"/> foreign language when you have difficulty
            in expressing yourself in your own or lack complete fluency in it.</p>
          <p>A man ought to read historical books, the biographies of famous men and writings on the
            fate of nations, for in this way, despite the shortness of life, he becomes, as it were,
            a contemporary of peoples of bygone days, communes with them and knows their good and
            bad sides.</p>
          <p>Your way of life should be similar to that of the first generation of Islam. Read the
            biography of the Prophet, may Allāh bless him and give him peace, acquaint yourself with
            his doings and the circumstances of his life, follow his example and do your utmost to
            emulate him. If you get to know his habits as to food, drink, dress, sleep, waking,
            sickness, medical treatment, amusement and use of perfumes and his attitude toward the
            Lord, his wives, his friends and his foes, and if you adopt only a small portion of all
            this, you will be among the happiest of men.</p>
          <p>You should be suspicious of yourself and not conceited. You should submit your opinion
            of scholars and their writings to a critical scrutiny, proceeding with caution, without
            haste or bias, for bias is a pitfall and rashness a stumbling block. He who has never
            rubbed his forehead against the doors of scholars cannot boast of being steeped in
            learning. He who has never been abashed by scholars will not be revered by man, and he
            who has never been blamed by them has never been properly admonished. Whoever does not
            endure the pain of study will never experience the pleasure of knowledge. He who does
            not toil will never reap fruit.</p>
          <p>When you interrupt your studying and thinking, exert your tongue in speaking Allāh's
            name and proclaiming His glory, especially before going to sleep; for then the meaning
            of the words will be absorbed by your innermost being, your mind will assimilate it and
            you will dwell upon it in your sleep. <pb n="867" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>When you feel pleasure or joy about anything in this world, remember death, the
            transience of life and the many kinds of affliction, and when you are grieved by
            something, say: Verily we are Allāh's, and to Him do we return [Sura II, 156]; and when
            you have been thoughtless, ask Allāh's forgiveness.</p>
          <p>Always keep death before your mind's eye and make knowledge and fear of God your
            provision for the world to come. If you should intend to disobey Allāh, choose a place
            where you cannot be seen; but take warning that men are the eyes of God that watch every
            human being; a man discloses his good deeds even if he performs them in secret, and his
            evil doings even if he conceals them. His inward being is laid bare before God, and God
            discloses it to His servants. You should see to it, therefore, that your hidden
            qualities are better than your visible ones, and your inner thoughts sounder than your
            manifest ones.</p>
          <p>Do not be grieved if you are not lucky in wordly affairs; if you were, you would
            thereby be distracted from attaining scientific knowledge, for a rich man seldom engages
            deeply in science, unless he is a man of high aspirations or become rich when he had
            already acquired science. Still, I do not claim that wordly success eludes the student
            of science; rather, it is he who pays no attention to mundane affairs, since his
            ambition is directed elsewhere, so that he has no time to think of accumulating
            riches.</p>
          <p>Wealth is attained by ambition and careful thought of the means by which to attain it.
            If these means are neglected, it will not come of itself. Moreover, the student of
            science disdains mean occupations and base ways of gaining profit, as he does all kinds
            of commerce. He would not demean himself before the lords of this world by petitioning
            at their gates.</p>
          <p>A friend of mine composed these lines: <pb n="868" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <quote><p><l>Whoever exerts himself in the quest of knowledge is spared </l><l> By the
                dignity of knowledge, the meanness of material gains.</l></p></quote>
          <p>All the ways of gaining wordly possessions require utter devotion, special skill and
            much expenditure of time. A person applying himself to science can afford nothing of
            this. He can only wait for wealth to come to him without any effort on his part, seeking
            him out without his seeking it, as he does other things. This seems to be unjust. But
            when a man has become proficient in science and has gained fame through it, he is sought
            after from all quarters and many posts are offered to him. At this juncture, wealth
            approaches him humbly, and he takes it without having to debase himself or to betray his
            honor and faith. You should know that science diffuses a pleasant fragrance, which draws
            attention to him who possesses it, and it also spreads light and radiance, which
            illuminate him and make him known; just as it is the case with a musk-vendor, whose
            place is never mistaken and whose merchandise is readily recognised, or with a man
            walking in the dark of night and holding a torch. Moreover, the savant is always
            beloved, wherever he stays. Everyone he meets is well-disposed toward him, delights in
            his company, appreciates his presence and enjoys his proximity.</p>
          <p>Let it be known to you that sciences may dry up at one time and spring forth at
            another, just like plants and water sources. They may also move from one nation to
            another and from one region to another.</p>
          <p>I have also copied from his handwritings the following sayings of of his:</p>
          <p>Your diction should, for the most part, possess the following qualities. It should be
            concise and should clearly express some important or interesting ideas. It may, however,
            contain some ambiguities and a greater or smaller number of allusions. It <pb n="869"
              ed="kopf"/> should not be dull like the speech of common people. Raise it above their
            level, but not too far.</p>
          <p>Beware of prattle, of idle talk, but beware also of keeping silent where the need
            arises, or you are called upon, to defend a right, to win someone's friendship or to
            extol a merit. Beware of laughing while you speak, and of excessive chatter and
            distorted speech; speak coherently and composedly, so as to suggest that you keep in
            reserve more than you express and that your words are the result of careful
            consideration.</p>
          <p>Beware of being gruff in addressing people or rude in debate, for this will destroy the
            persuasive power of your words, nullify their usefulness and take away their charm;
            moreover, it will cause resentment and wipe out friendship: the speaker will be disliked
            and the listener will prefer his silence to his speech, people will be roused to oppose
            him and tongues will be loosened to vilify and disparage him.</p>
          <p>Do not exalt yourself so much as to be loathed, and do not lower yourself so much as to
            be despised and looked upon with contempt.</p>
          <p>Always speak seriously and answer deliberately, not in a mechanical, stereotyped
            way.</p>
          <p>Give up childish habits and cease to be guided by your instincts. Your talk should, as
            a rule, be of sacred things, never without a quotation of a religious tradition, a
            Qur'ānic passage, a saying of a savant, an unusual line of poetry or a well-known
            proverb.</p>
          <p>Avoid slandering people, defaming kings, being harsh to a companion and displaying bad
            temper.</p>
          <p>Learn by heart all you can of proverbial lines of poetry, remarkable sayings of savants
            and interesting expressions.</p>

          <p> ʿImrān al-Isrā'īlī, the physician Auhad al-Dīn ʿImrān b. Sadaqa, was born in Damascus
            in 561/1175.</p>

          <p>His father was also a renowned physician. Studying medicine under the guidance of
            Shaykh Radī al-Dīn al-Rahbī, ʿImrān attained distinction in both the theory and practice
            of that art and became one of the greatest medical authorities. He gained great prestige
            with kings, who fully relied upon him as to medicinal and clinical treatment and
            rewarded him with countless monetary and other remunerations. He acquired more books on
            medicine and other subjects than hardly anyone else. But he never attached himself to
            the personal service of a king or accompanied him on his travels. Yet whenever a king
            fell ill or someone had difficulty in calling on him, he treated him devotedly until the
            cure was complete. Al-Malik al-Adil Abū Bakr b. Ayyub tried hard to engage him for his
            own personal service, but he failed, as did other kings.</p>
          <p>I have it on the authority of the Amir Sārim al-Dīn al-Tabnīnī, may Allāh have mercy
            upon him, that during his stay in al-Kirk, al-Malik al-Nāsir Dāʿūd, son of al-Malik
            al-Muʿazzam at that time ruler of the town, suffered from an indisposition of his
            temperament. After he had called the physician ʿImrān from Damascus to attend him, the
            latter stayed with him a short while, during which he treated him so well that he
            recovered. Thereupon Dā'ud presented the physician with a robe of honor and a large
            amount of money. Moreover, he offered him a monthly salary of 1,500 dirhams if he would
            enter his service and even agreed to advance him the sum of 27,000 dirhams, being his
            salary for eighteen months. But ʿImrān declined. <pb n="879" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>The Sultan al-Malik al-ʿĀdil bestowed upon ʿImrān numerous presents, in addition to a
            high monthly salary and special grants. At that time, ʿImrān stayed in Damascus and
            regularly attended the members of the Sultan's household in the citadel. The same was
            the case in the reign of al-Malik al-Muʿazzam, who likewise assigned him a monthly
            salary and a special grant. He regularly visited the Great Hospital to treat the
            inmates. At that time, my teacher Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. ʿAlī — may Allāh
            have mercy upon him — also worked at that hospital, and the cooperation of the two
            yielded most gratifying results and proved very beneficial to the patients. At that time
            I was training under their guidance, in the practical application of medicine, and so I
            was able to witness ʿImrān's amazing feats of therapy and diagnosis. One day, for
            example, a hemiplegic was brought to the hospital, and the physicians insisted that he
            should be given certain decoctions and other medicines which they were wont to
            prescribe. When ʿImrān saw him, he put him on a diet for that day and later ordered him
            to be bled. After the bloodletting, he treated him until he was completely restored to
            health. I also observed many times how he prescribed to patients certain drinks and
            dishes in accordance with their desires but still in keeping with the requirements of
            treatment, and they proved beneficial. This is a very important aspect of therapy. I
            also saw him treat many chronic sufferers who had become weary of life and of whom the
            physicians despaired of curing. They recovered through strange drugs he prescribed and
            wonderful cures he knew. I have reported some examples in my book "Experiences and
            Morals." ʿImrān died in Homs in the month of Jumādā I, 637/1240, after responding to the
            call of the ruler of that city to come and attend him. <pb n="880" ed="kopf"/>

          <head><persName>Muwaffaq al-Dīn Yaʿqub b. Siqlāb,</persName></head>
          <p> a Christian, was unequaled in his time in the knowledge, understanding and correct
            interpretation of the works of Galen. Owing to his zeal for medicine, his ardent desire
            to read and study the above works, his outstanding talent and great intelligence, the
            entire contents of Galen's writings were always at his fingertips. Thus, whatever he
            would say concerning medicine — its various divisions, multifaceted topics and fine
            details — he always quoted in the name of Galen and whenever he was asked a question
            concerning a medical problem, whether difficult or relatively simple, he invariably
            replied by "Galen says" and adduced pertinent passages from his works, word for word.
            For this he was greatly admired. Sometimes, when quoting Galen, he even indicated the
            page of the respective chapter where the passage was to be found, referring to the copy
            in his possession, for he had read it so many times that he had known it by heart.</p>
          <p>On one occasion I had the opportunity of observing his vast knowledge. At the start of
            my medical studies, I read something of Hippocrates under his guidance, in order to
            memorize it and receive explanations. At that time, we were staying in al-Muʿazzam's
            military encampment, where my father too, was employed in the service of al-Malik
            al-Muʿazzam, may Allāh have mercy upon him. On that occasion, I was able to observe that
            Muwaffaq al Dīn contrived to give such lucid explanations and interpret the subject
            matter so thoroughly and in such clear and concise language as no one else would have
            been able to do. Thereafter he gave the gist of what he had said, so that he left
            nothing of the sayings of Hippocrates that he had not explained in the best way
            possible. In addition, he mentioned what Galen in his commentary had said with regard to
            the chapter in question, quoting it fluently from beginning to end. When looking up the
            passage in the original, I found that Muwaffaq al-Dīn had recited the whole text without
            omitting anything, and in many <pb n="881" ed="kopf"/> instances had even repeated the
            very words used by Galen, without adding or leaving out a single one. This is a feat
            such as he alone, of all his contemporaries, could boast of.</p>
          <p>During his stay in Damascus, Muwaffaq al-Dīn frequently met the Shaykh Muhadhdhab
            al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm b. ʿAlī, in the place assigned to the physicians at the Sultan's
            residence, and the two would discuss various medical topics. Shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn
            had a better diction, was brighter and a more skilled debator, which Yaʿqub was more
            deliberate, expressed himself more lucidly and had more traditional texts at his
            command; for he was, so to speak, in the position of an interpreter who could always
            draw on what Galen had said about medicine in his various books.</p>
          <p>As to the therapeutics of the physician Yaʿqub, they were unsurpassable. He first
            determined the nature of the disease in a most thorough manner and then began treatment
            according to the rules laid down by Galen, yet using his own discretion with regard to
            what should be applied in each specific case. He took great pains in his examinations
            and made every effort to consider all the symptoms. Whenever he examined a patient, he
            questioned him minutely about each of his symptoms and complaints, and never overlooked
            any symptom likely to help him in diagnosing the disease, so that his treatment was
            always excellent. Al-Malik al Muʿazzam praised him for this quality. Describing his
            character, he said: "If it were the only merit of the physician Yaʿqub that he takes the
            utmost care in diagnosing diseases, so as to treat them correctly, without any doubt as
            to their nature [it would be enough].</p>
          <p>Yaʿqub mastered the Greak language and expertly translated from it into Arabic. He had
            in his possession some of Galen's works in the Greek original, such as "Strategem of
            Healing," "Maladies" and Symptoms," and others, which he constantly read and studied.
              <pb n="882" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>He was born in Jerusalem and lived there for many years. In that city he maintained
            close contact with a philosopher, a monk of the al-Siq Monastery, who was an expert
            naturalist, had mastered geometry and arithmetic and was well versed in astrology and
            the observation of stars. He made correct prognoses and gave amazing forewarnings.
            Yaʿqūb told me a great deal about his knowledge of philosophy, his ingenuity and his
            sagacity.</p>
          <p>In Jerusalem Yaʿqūb also met Shaykh Abū Mansūr al-Nasrānī, a physician, under whom he
            studied. He assisted him in his medical practice and profited greatly thereby.</p>
          <p>Yaʿqūb was a most clever, sensible and even-tempered person. While he was in the
            personal service of al-Malik al-Muʿazzam ʿĪsā b. Abī Bakr b. Ayyūb, the latter placed so
            much faith in him that he asked his advice not only in medical matters but in other
            affairs as well, and when he followed it, he was always satisfied with the outcome. He
            wanted to appoint Yaʿqūb to a post in the administration of his realm, but the latter
            declined, preferring to devote himself entirely to medicine.</p>
          <p>Yaʿqūb suffered from gout in both legs and was sometimes in so much pain that he was
            hardly able to move. Al-Malik al-Muʿazzam, therefore, when taking him along on his
            travels, had him laid on a stretcher and took good care of him. He honored him greatly,
            allotted him a considerable monthly salary and bestowed on him many favors. One day he
            asked him: "Why don't you cure that ailment in your legs?" Yaʿqūb replied: "When wood
            has become worm-eaten, there is no way to cure it."</p>
          <p>Yaʿqūb remained in the service of al-Malik al-Muʿazzam until the latter's death. The
            Sultan died, may Allāh have mercy upon him, in Damascus at three o'clock on Friday, the
            last day of Dhū-al-Daʿda, 624/1227, He was succeeded by his son, al-Malik al-Nāsir
            Dā'ud. <pb n="883" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>When Yaʿqūb called on al-Malik al-Nāsir, he mentioned — after saluting him — his
            service of many years and remarked that he had grown old and feeble. He then recited the
            following lines by Ibn Munkidh, may Allāh have mercy upon him:</p>
          <quote><p><l>I came to you when the garments of youth were still fresh, </l><l> How should
                I leave you whom they have become worn out? </l><l> I can claim the respect due to a
                guest, to a protege of long standing</l><l> And to one who came to you when the
                tribesmen were still youths.</l></p></quote>
          <p>Upon hearing this, al-Malik al-Nāsir treated him very kindly, gave him money and
            apparel and ordered that he should continue to receive all he had been granted by
            al-Malik al-Muʿazzam, without having to report for duty. He lived a little longer, and
            then died in Damascus on the Christian Easter, i.e., in the month of Rabīʿ II, in the
            year 625/1228.</p>

          <p> The illustrious and learned physician Abū Mansūr, son of the physician Muwaffaq al-Dīn
            Yaʿqūb b. Siqlāb, was an outstanding physician and scholar, an expert in the theory and
            practice of medicine, both general and specialized. He studied under his father and
            others. In al-Kirk he also studied a great number of the philosophical sciences under
            the Imām Shams al-Dīn al-Uhashrūshāhī. When in the service of al-Malik al-Nāsir Salāh
            al-Dīn Dā'ūd, son of the al-Malik al-Muʿazzam ʿĪsā b. Abī Bakr b. Ayyūb, he stayed with
            him in al-Kirk and won his esteem and confidence in medical matters. He later moved to
            Damascus, where he died.</p>

          <p> Abū 'l-Mansūr b. Abī al-Fadl b. ʿAlī al-Surī had a comprehensive knowledge of general
            medicine and was <pb n="884" ed="kopf"/> well acquainted with the obvious and hidden
            advantages of this art. No one had his knowledge of simple drugs, their nature,
            different names and descriptions, specific properties and effects.</p>
          <p>He was born in 573/1177 in the city of Tyre, He grew up there, but later left his
            hometown. Studying medicine under Shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz and Shaykh
            Muwaffaq al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Latīf b. Yūsuf al-Baghdādī, he distinguished himself in this
            art. For some years he resided in Jerusalem, where he practiced in the local hospital
            and became friendly with Shaykh Abū-al-ʿAbbās al-Jayyānī. The latter was an outstanding
            authority on simple drugs, a versatile scholar and a pious and charitable man. From his
            friendship with him Rashīd al-Dīn was enriched. He learnt from him most of the things he
            knew and made himself so well acquainted with the specific properties of many simple
            drugs that he surpassed most experts in this field and all those who sought to be
            experts. Endowed with shining virtues, unparalleled real, remarkable learning and
            extraordinary courage, he put his newly acquired knowledge to good use.</p>
          <p>In 612/1215, Rashīd al-Dīn entered the medical service of al-Malik al-ʿAdil Abū Bakr b.
            Ayyūb, and when the latter set out for Egypt, he accompanied him from Jerusalem and
            remained in his service until al-Malik al-ʿAdil died, may Allāh have mercy upon him.
            Thereafter he entered the service of al-Malik al-ʿAdil's son, al-Malik al-Muʿazzam ʿĪsā
            b. Abī Bakr, enjoying his full confidence and gaining great prestige during his reign.
            By his side, he took part in a number of summer campaigns against the Franks, when they
            were besieging the fortress of Damiette. He remained in his service until his death.</p>
          <p>Al-Malik al-Muʿazzam was succeeded by his son, al-Malik al-Nāsir Da'ud, who continued
            to pay Rashīd al-Dīn his monthly salary. In consideration of his previous service, he
            appointed him chief <pb n="885" ed="kopf"/> physician. Rashīd al-Dīn remained in
            al-Malik al-Nāsir's service until the latter set out for al-Kirk. He then settled in
            Damascus, where he established a study circle for medicine, which was patronised by many
            who were eager to study the subject under his guidance. He also drew up a prescription
            for the great theriac, the ingredients of which he compounded judiciously, so that it
            was highly effective. He had already prepared it in abundance in the days of al-Malik
            al-Muʿazzam.</p>
          <p>Rashīd al-Dīn b. al-Surī died, may Allāh have mercy upon him, in Damascus on Sunday the
            1st of Rajab 639/1242. He presented me with one of his works containing medical advice
            and recommendations. On that occasion, I wrote him the following letter, beginning with
            a poem [the poem follows.]</p>
          <p>Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Abū Nasr Muḥammad b. Muḥammad b. Ibrāhīm b. al-Khidr, of Aleppo,
            recited to me the following poem, in which he praised the physician Rashīd al-Dīn b.
            al-Sūrī and thanked him for a favor he had bestowed upon him . . . . . . . . . .</p>
          <p>Rashīd al-Dīn al-Surī wrote the following works:</p>
          <list>
            <item n="1"> "The Book of Simple Drugs." He started writing it in the days of al-Malik
              al-Muʿazzam, whose name he used in its title. He gave in it a full account of all
              simples, including some which he himself had discovered and tried out and which had
              not been mentioned by his predecessors. He secured the cooperation of a painter, who
              had at his disposal all kinds and shades of color. He made it his habit to visit
              places grown with plants, such as Mount Lebanon, each of which was distinguished by a
              specific flora. After inspecting the plants, he showed them to the painter, who, after
              contemplating their color and examining their leaves, branches and roots, reproduced
              their likeness accordingly and to the best of his ability. Moreover, Rashīd al-Dīn
              employed a very useful method of representing plants. He showed them to the painter at
              three stages: <pb n="886" ed="kopf"/> sprouting and tender; full-grown and seeding;
              and withering and drying up. The artist then painted them at these stages, and so the
              user of the book, seeing them in all the conditions in which he was liable to
              encounter them in nature, was in a position to obtain more perfect knowledge and
              clearer notions.</item>

          <head><persName>Sadīd al-Dīn b. Raqīqa.</persName></head>
          <p> Abū 'l-Thanāʿ, Maḥmūd b. ʿUmar b. Muḥammad b. Ibrāhīm b. Shujaʿ al-Shaibānī al-Hānawī,
            known as b. Raqīqa was a man endowed with an excellent character and perfect virtues.
            Having familiarized himself with the medical teachings of the Ancients, scattered over a
            great number of writings, he surpassed all his fellow physicians and healers. Moreover,
            he possessed a beautiful diction, a rhetorical style and a gift for composing marvelous
            poems, many lines of which became proverbial. As to the Rajaz meter [used for didactic
            poems], I never saw in his time any physician more dexterous than he in using it. He
            could take any medical work and put it into Rajaz meter in a trice, without omitting
            anything of its contents and retaining beautiful language. He frequented Shaykh Fakhr
            al-Dīn b. ʿAbd al-Salām al-Māridīnī and was closely associated with him, studying
            medicine and other sciences under his guidance. He was also familiar with ophthalmology
            and surgery and, in treating eye diseases, performed many operations with the iron. In
            addition, he extracted cataracts from the eyes of many patients, who, thanks to his
            skill, regained their eyesight. The instrument he used was hollow and curved, so that,
            after the incision, it was better able to draw out the water and the operation became
            more effective.  <pb n="887" ed="kopf"/></p>

          <p>Ibn Raqīqa also concerned himself with astrology and studied the "Mechanical
            Contrivances of the Sons of Mūsā [Ibn Shākir], from which he learnt to make amazing
            things. In addition, he possessed a sound knowledge of grammar and lexicology. He had a
            learned brother, named Muʿīn al-Dīn, who was the greatest authority of his time on the
            Arabic language — his main pursuit — but who also composed numerous poems.</p>
          <p>Ibn Raqīqa, moreover, heard lectures on the Hadīth. Of the traditions he transmitted, I
            heard the following from his mouth: [there follows the chain of tradition, leading back
            to ʿAisha, the Prophet's wife, and then the hadīth itself, which consists of lines of
            poetry. The report fills one page of the Arabic text.]</p>
          <p>I have it from Sadīd al-Dīn b. Raqīqa himself that he was born in 564/1168 in the city
            of Hīnī, where he also grew up. When Fakhr al-Dīn al-Māridīnī was staying in Hīnī, the
            ruler of the town, Nūr al-Dīn b. Jamāl al-Dīn b. Artaq, contracted an eye disease.
            Shaykh Fakhr al-Dīn treated him for a number of days, but then had to leave and
            therefore advised Nūr al-Dīn b. Artaq to have himself treated by Sadīd al-Dīn b. Raqīqa.
            The latter cured him within a short time. When he had completely recovered, he allotted
            to Sadīd al-Dīn a monthly salary and a grant in consideration of his services. Sadīd
            al-Dīn, as he told me himself, was at that time not yet twenty years old. He remained in
            Nur al-Dīn's service for some time.</p>
          <p>Later he entered the service of the ruler of Hamāt, al-Malik al-Mansūr Muḥammad b. Taqī
            al-Dīn ʿAmr, with whom he stayed for a time. Thereafter he went to Khalāt which was then
            ruled by al-Malik al-Auhad Najm al-Dīn Ayyūb, son of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr b.
            Ayyūb, and entered the service of <pb n="888" ed="kopf"/> Salāh al-Dīn b. Yāghībsān. The
            latter's sister who had been married to al-Malik al-Auhad, also availed herself of Sadīd
            al-Dīn's medical care, and treated him with great kindness. He stayed in Khalāt until
            the death of al-Malik al-Auhad. The latter died of rheumatism in Manāz on Saturday, the
            18th of Rabīʿ I, 609/1212. Sadīd al-Dīn had been treating him together with Sadaqa the
            Samaritan.</p>
          <p>Later, Sadīd al-Dīn entered the service of al-Malik al-Ashraf Abū 'l-Fath Mūsā, the son
            of Malik al-ʿĀdil. After staying in Māyūfāriqīn for a number of years, he arrived at the
            court of al-Malik al-Ashraf in Damascus, on the 3rd of Jumada II, 632/1235 and was
            kindly received and greatly honored. Al-Malik al-Ashraf ordered him to attend the
            Sultan's household in the citadel and to treat the patients at the Hospital established
            by al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn b. Zengī. He allotted him a monthly salary and a grant.
            At the same time, Sadīd al-Dīn received similar payments for treating the patients at
            that hospital. We were close friends for a time, and what I was able to observe of his
            perfect character, noble mind, great scholarships and excellent performance in
            diagnosing and treating diseases is beyond all description. He continued to stay in
            Damascus, occupying himself with medicine, until he died — may Allāh have mercy upon him
            — in 635/1238. As to myself, I had already moved to Sarkhad in the month of Rabīʿ I,
            634/1237 in order to enter the service of its ruler, the ʿAmīr ʿIzz al-Dīn
            al-Mʿuazzami.</p>
          <p>[Here follow about eight and a half pages of b. Raqīqa's poetry, including the
            following medical recommendations]:</p>
          <quote><p><l>Beware of filling yourself with food — keep away from it;</l><l> Do not take
                a meal before having digested the previous one.</l><l> Also avoid over-indulging in

                of illness</l><l> Do not drink water immediately after eating,</l><l> Then you will

                Even to him who is burning with thirst.</l><l> Watch your digestion — this is very
                important —</l><l> And undergo a purgative cure every year.</l><l> As to
                venesection, refrain from it</l><l> Unless a patient has soft stools and observes a
                diet.</l><l> Do not move about immediately after eating,</l><l> But only after
                having digested,</l><l> In order to prevent the chyme from descending all of a
                sudden, </l><l> In which case it will stick to the ducts and pores. </l><l>
                Likewise, do not rest too long,</l><l> For this produces all kinds of unhealthy

          <p> Sadaka b. Manja b. Sadaka the Samaritan was a great medical authority. He was very
            industrious, fond of study and research. Knowledgeable and keen-witted he was also at
            home in philosophy, whose mysteries he fathomed. In addition to teaching medicine, he
            was a writer of mediocre poems, in which he often inserted philosophical sayings, but
            mostly he composed distichs. He also wrote philosophical and medical works. He spent a
            good many years in the service of al-Malik al-Ashraf Mūsā, son of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū
            Bakr b. Ayyūb, with whom he stayed in the East until his death. Al-Malik al-Ashraf held
            him in high esteem and honored him greatly. Relying on him in all medical matters he
            allotted him a generous allowance and constant favors. Sadaqa died in the city of Harrān
            a few years after 620/1223. He left a large fortune, but no children.</p>
          <p>The following are some of his sayings, which I have copied from his own
            manuscripts:</p>
          <p>"Fasting denies the body its nourishment, guards the senses against error and the limbs
            from sin; it is the overall remedy against anything which interferes with the worship of
            Allāh."</p>
          <p>"Know that all acts of worship are open except fasting, which can be seen by Allāh
            alone; for it is an inner act of pure perseverance. Fasting has three degrees: the
            general fast, which consists <pb n="891" ed="kopf"/> in ignoring the stomach and
            dismissing the instincts; the special fast, which consists in keeping the ear, eye,
            tongue and the other organs from sin; the extra-special fast, consisting in the soul's
            abstinence from worldly cares and thoughts of the body its concentration solely on
            Allāh, glory be to him."</p>
          <p>"The body's secretions that are unchangeable and indurable —tears, sweat, spittle and
            mucus — are pure; while the durable and changeable secretions, — urine and excrement —
            are impure."</p>
          <p>"Know that the word vizier [wazir] is derived from the expression 'to carry a burden'
            [wizr] for those whom he is serving; but the bearing of this burden would be impossible
            if the vizier [carrier] were not perfect in his nature and qualities. As for his person,
            he should cut a fine figure and be of pleasing appearance, with well-proportioned limbs
            and sound senses: as for his character, he should be magnanimous and zealous,
            intelligent and intuitive, with true nobility, simple generosity, good education — a man
            of the world. When he is this kind of man, he is the best prop of the state, for he
            would keep the ruler from ruin, raise him from meanness, and paves the way for him; he
            would serve as an instrument for the fulfillment of each purpose, like a wall guarding
            the state from every danger, like a falcon pursuing food for its master. But not
            everyone who is thus qualified can serve every ruler, for he must also be known for his
            devotion to his master, his love for his benefactor, his preference for the one who has
            raised his position."</p>
          <p>"The patience of the chaste is graceful."</p>
          <p>[There follows a collection of his poetry].</p>
          <p>He also wrote:</p>
          <quote><p><l>You, who inherited from father and grandfather </l><l> The stamp of medicine
                and dignity,</l><l> "You who are the guarantor for the return of every soul <pb
                  n="892" ed="kopf"/>
              </l><l> Which aspires to leave the body,</l><l> "I swear, if medicine could cure Time,
                </l><l> We would exist without Death."</l></p></quote>

          <p> The Shaykh and Imām, Master and Vizier Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Yūsuf b. Abī Saʿīd b. Khalaf
            al-Sāmirī mastered the science of medicine, distinguished himself in the philosophical
            sciences, devoted himself to the literary arts and attained the supreme degree of
            virtue. He was most benevolent, full of generosity, noble-hearted and sensible. He
            studied medicine with the physician Ibrāhīm al-Samiri, known as "the Sun of physicians,
            " who served al-Malik al-Nasir Saladin Yūsuf. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn also studied with the
            Shaykh Isma'īl b. Abī al-Waqqār the physician, and Muhadhadhab al-Dīn b. al-Naqqāsh. He
            studied literature under Tag al-Dīn al-Kindī Abū al-Yaman. In medicine he was
            celebrated, for his therapeutics. The following story may serve as an illustration.</p>
          <p>Sitt al-Shām, the sister of al-Malik al-Adil Abū Bakr b. Ayyūb, was afflicted with
            dysentery of the liver, which caused her strong hemorrhages every day. The physicians
            were treating her with the usual remedies against this disease, such as potions, etc.
            When <pb n="893" ed="kopf"/> Muhadhdhab al-Dīn came and took her pulse he said to the
            assembly: "O sirs, as long as she has some strength left, give her camphor, to rectify
            the acute disorder that is the reason for her present condition." He ordered imperial
            camphor to be brought and administered to her together with roasted seeds and a potion
            concocted from pomegranates and sandal-wood. Her hemorrhage lessened and her liver
            became less inflamed. He administered this potion again the next day and her condition
            improved further. This way he treated her gently until she took a turn for the better
            and finally eventually recovered completely.</p>
          <p>A companion of Ibn Shukr, the Vizier of al-Malik al-ʿAdil, told me the following story.
            Once our Vizier suffered from pain in his back, due to the cold. Some physicians who
            came to attend him treated him by correcting his diet, in addition to applying a little
            castoreum boiled and mixed with olive-oil; others suggested anointment with cotula and
            mastic. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn said: "For his good, instead of all these, he should be given
            something which has both value and a pleasant smell." This utterance aroused the wonder
            of the Vizier. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn said: "For his good, instead of all these, he should be
            given something which has both value and a pleasant smell." This utterance aroused the
            wonder of the Vizier. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn then ordered perfume composed of musk and
            ambergris and clear oil brought to him, which he dissolved over the fire, and anointed
            the painful area. The patient was greatly relieved.</p>
          <p>Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Yūsuf served ʿIzzal- Dīn Farrukhshāh b. Shāhinshāh b. Ayyūb as
            physician when this ruler died, mercy be upon him, in Jumādā, I, 578/1182-3, he became
            the medical attendant of his son, al-Malik al-Amjad Mazd al-Dīn Bahrām-shāh b. ʿĪsā
            al-Dīn Farrukhshāh, staying with him in Baʿalbekk. During this ruler's lifetime,
            Muhadhdhab al-Dīn's rank was greatly elevated; he received much money and many favors
            from his master, who used to consult him in his affairs and rely on him in his
            enterprises, for our Shaykh was a man of sound intelligence, vast knowledge and great
            talent. The ruler, finding his views sound and his aims praiseworthy, finally made him
            his Vizier. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn dedicated <pb n="894" ed="kopf"/> himself to his post; his
            power increased and his importance grew, until he became the actual director of all
            government affairs, all of which were carried out according to his commands and
            prohibitions.</p>
          <p>This was the subject of the poem composed about him by the Shaykh Shihab al-Dīn
            Fityan:</p>
          <quote><p><l>Al-Malik al-Amjad whose virtue</l><l> was celebrated by all kings,</l><l>
                Relied on al-Sāmirī to the same extent</l><l> as the latter relied on speed [in
                treatment]</l></p></quote>
          <p>These two strophes were recited to me by Shams al-Dīn Muḥammad b. Shihāb al-Dīn Fityān,
            who told me that he had heard them from his father.</p>
          <p>Ibn Abū Usaybiʿah continues: The Shaykh Muhadhadhab al-Dīn's position remained the same
            as to power and importance, until the complaints voiced by his own family and his
            Samaritan relatives grew too frequent; for a group of them had come up to him in
            Baʿalbekk from Damascus. He had given them positions everywhere, but they spead only
            oppression, waste and corruption, without anybody being able to protest, because of the
            great awe inspired by the Vizier Muhadhdhab al-Dīn al-Sāmirī. In short, when al-Malik
            al-Amjad realized their abuse of money and corruption and when he was accused by the
            rulers of delivering his kingdom to the Samaritans, he finally arrested Muhadhdhab
            al-Dīn al-Sāmirī and all the Samaritans who held government posts and extracted enormous
            sums of money from them.</p>
          <p>The Vizier remained in prison until he had nothing left of any value. He was then
            released and went to Damascus. I have seen him in his house, after coming from
            Baʿalbekk, for I came with my father to pay him a visit. I found a fine old man,
            eloquent and refined in <pb n="895" ed="kopf"/> speech. He died on a Thursday, at the
            beginning of Safar 624/ 1227, in Damascus.</p>
          <p>[A sample of his poetry follows.]</p>
          <p>Muhadhdhab al-Dīn Yūsuf wrote a commentary on the Pentateuch.</p>

          <head><persName>The Master Amīn al-Dawla.</persName></head>
          <p> The Master and Vizier, perfect in theory and practice, the respected chief, head of
            viziers, best of physicians, Imām of the learned, Amīn al-Dawlah Abū al-Ḥasan b. Ghazāl
            b. Abī Saʿīd, was a Samaritan who converted to Islam under the name Kamal al-Dīn.
            Muhadhadhab al-Dīn al-Sāmirī was his paternal uncle. This Amīn al-Dawlah was a man of
            unsurpassed intelligence, supreme knowledge, all-embracing benevolence, high aspirations
            and never-failing dignity. In the science of medicine he attained exhaustive knowledge,
            knowing full well its benefits, and mastering its principles and different branches, to
            the point where he had few peers, for even the experts and specialists could not rival
            his achievements.</p>
          <p>He first served al-Malik al-Amjad Majd al-Dīn Bahrām Shāh b. ʿIzz-al-Dīn Farrukhshāh b.
            Ayyūb, who relied on him in all medical matters and entrusted him with all the affairs
            of his government. He stayed with al-Malik al-Amjad until the latter's death, may Allāh
            have mercy upon him, which occurred in his palace in Damascus, on Tuesday evening, the
            11th of Shawāl, 628/1230. Thereafter he dispensed independently of the Vizirate under
            the rule of al-Malik al-Sālih ʿImād al-Dīn Abū al-Fidā' Ismaʿīl b. al-Malik al Adil Abū
            Bakr b. Ayyūb. In this capacity he governed the kingdom in the best way possible,
            directed its affairs with the utmost statesmanship, strengthened the foundations of the
            realm, erected and bolstered noble edifices, renovated the educational establishments
            for students and academicians and built up for himself a fame that had not been equaled
            by any of the ancients. <pb n="896" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>He remained in the service of al-Malik al-Sālih Ismaʿīl, enjoying extensive powers,
            absolute obedience, and high importance, until al-Malik al-Sālih Najm al-Dīn Ayyub b.
            al-Malik al-Kāmil conquered Damascus and appointed the Emir Muʿin al-Dīn b. Shaykh
            al-Shuiūkh his delegate there. When he took the city, he gave al-Malik al-Salih Ismaʿīl
            Baʿalbek, where he moved with his family and possessions, in the year 643/1245-6. During
            his Vizierate, Amin al-Dawlah set his mind to collecting money, which he indeed gathered
            for his master al-Malik al-Sālih Ismaʿīl in great sums, by the expropriation of many of
            the citizens of Damascus, with the help of the city's Chief Justice, Rafīʿ al-Dīn
            al-Jīlī, and his following. When the Emir Muʿīn al-Dīn b. Shaykh al-Shuykh, the Sultan's
            delegate in Damascus, the Damascene Vizier Jamāl al-Dīn b. al-Matrūh and the notables of
            the realm became aware of the sums amassed by Amin al-Dawlah, they decided to arrest and
            dispossess him. With this in mind, they prepared a trap: inviting him to their assembly,
            they welcomed him by standing up and giving him a great oration, so that he felt quite
            secure, then they came forth with an ultimatum — "Either you stay in Damascus with
            nothing but what you have right now, or you can go and join your master in Baʿalbekk."
            He answered: In the name of God, indeed I shall to to join my master and stay with him."
            Leaving them thus, he gathered all his money, treasures, revenues and all his
            possessions down to the furniture, locked his house, loaded the whole on a few mules and
            took off to Baʿalbekk. When he was just outside Damascus he was arrested; all he had
            with him was seized and taken away and he was threwn into prison. This took place on
            Friday, the 2nd of Rajab, 643/1245. He was then sent under guard to Egypt and imprisoned
            in the fortress of Cairo, together with other companions of al-Malik al-Sālih
            Ismaʿīl.</p>
          <p>Several years passed and then al-Malik al-Sālih Najm al-Dīn Ayyūb died in Egypt in the
            year 647/1249. Al-Malik al-Nāsir Yūsuf <pb n="897" ed="kopf"/> b. Muḥammad left Aleppo
            and conquered Damascus on Sunday, the 8th of Rabiʿ II, 648/1250. He took with him
            al-Malik al-Sālih Ismaʿīl and the other Syrian rulers and went to Egygt in order to
            conquer the land. The Egyptian armies came to meet him. (Egypt at that time was ruled by
            al-Malik al-Muʿizz ʿIzz al-Dīn Aibak the Turcoman, who came to power after the death of
            his master al-Malik al-Sālih Najm-al-Dīn Ayyub.) The two armies engaged in a battle in
            which the Egyptian side was first defeated, and then the Syrian troops were totally
            crushed. Al-Malik al-Sālih Ismaʿīl and a great many of the [Syrian] kings and princes
            were captured and imprisoned in Egypt. Later, some of them were set free, but al-Malik
            al-Sālih Ismaʿīl was not heard of thereafter and it was rumored that he was hanged.</p>
          <p>The Emir Saif al-Dīn al-Mushadd ʿAlī b. ʿUmar, may he be blessed, told me the
            following. When the Vizier Amin al-Dawlah heard in the fort of Cairo the news coming
            from Bilbeis announcing the defeat of the Egyptian army by the Syrian Troops, he said to
            the fort commander: "Let us free in the fort until the [Syrian] kings come, and then you
            will see how well we shall treat you." He was tempted and let them out. In that part of
            the prison there were three of al-Malik al-Sālih Ismaʿīl's companions, namely his Vizier
            Amin al-Dawlah, his Major domo Nasir al-Dīn b. Yaghmūr and an Emir Kurd called Saif
            al-Dīn. "My friends," said the Kurd, "do not hurry; wait in your places until we find
            out the truth of the matter. For the arrival of our master will surely free us and
            restore us to our former positions, shower favors upon us and save us. But if this news
            be false, we shall be found still in our places, which will be better for us." Not
            accepting this, the Vizier Amīn al-Dawlah and Nāsir al-Dīn Yaghmūr went out, giving out
            orders around the fort, commanding and prohibiting. When the outcome of the battle
            proved to be contrary to what they had hoped, ʿIzz al-Dīn al-Turcomani <pb n="898"
              ed="kopf"/> ascended the fort and ordered Nasir al-Dīn b. Yaghmūr to be killed and the
            Vizier to be hanged, and both orders were executed promptly. A witness to the strangling
            told me that the Vizier was clad in a green prisoner's gown, and his feet shod in boots
            of a type which he had never before seen on a hanged man. As to their companion the
            Kurd, he was set free with honors and favors.</p>
          <p>Ibn Abū Usaybiʿah continues. The most curious anecdote concerning astrology, relevant
            to these events, was told to be my the Emir Nāsir al-Dīn Zikri, known as b. ʿAlīma, who
            was companion to al-Malik al-Sālih Najm al-Dīn Ayyūb. When Amin al-Dawlah was arrested
            by my master, he sent for an expert, an Egyptian astrologer, whose judgment was almost
            infallible, to inquire about his future and whether he would be released from prison.
            When this man received the message, he examined the ascendance of the sun at that
            moment, the respective degrees of the rising star, the twelve zodiac components and the
            star centers, wrote it all down under the horoscope and drew his conclusion accordingly:
            "The man," he said, "will be released from prison and leave it happy and gay: he will be
            favored by fortune and given a powerful post in Egypt, with a group of people obeying
            all his orders," Amīn al-Dawlah received the response joyfully. When he was informed of
            the victorious approach of the kings, he set out certain that he would remain a vizier
            in Egypt. Thus the astrologer's prediction of his release, future happiness and
            obedience to all his orders came true that day; but Amīn al-Dawlah did not suspect what
            was awaiting him, for Allāh, the glorious and omnipotent, was already engineering his
            predestined fate, written in the hidden Book.</p>
          <p>The master Amīn al-Dawlah had a virtuous soul and took a keen interest in collecting
            books. He purchased many magnificent editions of various scientific works and always
            kept copyists in his service. Once he desired a copy of "The History of Damascus" by
            al-Hafiz b. al-ʿAsākir, comprising eighty volumes in petite script. Considering it too
            long to be done by just one copyist, he divided the book <pb n="899" ed="kopf"/> equally
            among ten. They finished the work in about two years and the whole book came into his
            possession; this shows his extreme ambition.</p>
          <p>When he, may God bless him, was still in Damascus, enjoying full powers as a vizier, in
            the days of al-Malik al-Salih Ismaʿīl, he was an intimate friend of my father's. One day
            he said to him: "O, Sadīd al-Dīn, I have heard that your son has composed an unrivaled
            book about the classes of physicians, for which highly important work many of my own
            physicians praise him greatly in my presence. I have in my library more than twenty
            thousand volumes, but none in his special branch, and so I would like you to write to
            him, asking for a copy of this book." I was at the time in Sarkhad, staying with its
            governor, the Emir ʿIzz al-Dīn Aibak al-Muʿazzamī and taking his orders. Upon receiving
            my father's letter, I went to Damascus, carrying with me the rough copies of my book.
            There I called for the illustrious copyist Shams al-Dīn Muḥammad al-Hussaini, who used
            to do a great deal of work for us and whose handwriting was perfectly proportioned and
            his mastery of Arabic excellent. I gave him a room in our house, where he copied the
            book quickly, putting it into four parts, according to the division of Rubuʿ the
            Bagdadian. Having had them bound, I composed a penegyrical poem to the master Amīn
            al-Dawlah and sent him all this with the Chief Justice of Damascus, Rafīʿ al-Dīn
            al-Jīlī, who was one of my professors with whom I was on good terms and with whom I
            studied a part of Ibn Sīnā's "Book of Notes and Remarks." When Amīn al-Dawlah received
            my book and poem through the judge he was greatly surprised and extremely happy. He sent
            me back with the judge a large sum of money, honorary robes and many thanks, saying: "I
            should like you to notify me of every new book you write." Here is the poem I have
            composed in his honor, at the beginning of the year 643/1245. . . <pb n="900" ed="kopf"
            />
          </p>
          <p>I have copied the following strophes from a manuscript by the Shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn
            Hibat Allāh Abū al-Qasim b. ʿAbd al-Wahhāb b. Muḥammad b. All the scribe, known as Ibn
            al-Nahhās, written to the master Amīn al-Dawlah, in which he asked him for a manuscript
            promised him by al-Malik al-Amjad, in 627/ 1227. . .</p>
          <p>The following is part of a poem written in honor of the master Amin al-Dawla, as
            recited to me by the author himself, Sharf al-Dīn Ismaʿīl b. ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar the
            scribe, known as "the son of the Yemenite judge":</p>
          <quote><p><l>"Destiny altered my life, my pure happiness clouded over;</l><l> The tyrant
                Time turned my sweet life into bitter;</l><l> My love went away without looking
                back, while my heart yearned for the departed,</l><l> I wished to be cured from that
                disease, burning like fire within me, and you did cure me;</l><l> It was said to me:
                "When a disease is serious, a cure is rare and a helper much needed";</l><l> [I
                answered:] How can we complain of our aches and pains while the doctor is our
                Vizier?</l><l> Indeed I shall turn to him, our Vizier and master, do not worry, for
                his benevolence is great;</l><l> When a disease is fatal, nothing can cure it but an
                expert physician,</l><l> A chief, a master, a skillful doctor, a noble scholar, a
                great Vizier,</l><l> A gentle savior, a merciful author, bountiful, affectionate,
                honorable and selfless.</l></p></quote>

          <p>The master Amīn al-Dawlah wrote "The Clear Path to Medicine," one of the best books
            written on the science of medicine. He gathered into its five parts all of medicine's
            universal and particular laws.</p>
          <p>The first book deals with matters of nature, the three states of the body, the
            different kinds of disease; the symptoms of the moderate, natural and healthy humors of
            the main organs and the surrounding areas; also other matters, highly valuable and
            worthy of being mentioned in this context; then follows a discussion on the pulse,
            urine, excrement, delirum.</p>
          <p>The second book deals with simple drugs and their power.</p>
          <p>The third book discusses the compound drugs and their uses.</p>
          <p>The fourth book describes the regimen of the healthy and the treatment of manifest
            diseases, their causes and symptoms and what can be done by surgical means concerning
            the diseased organs and other parts of the body. Here he also treats the subject of
            proper clothing and behavior during the samum [very hot and dry weather].</p>
          <p>The fifth book is concerned with internal diseases, their causes, symptoms and
            treatment, and also the surgery that can be employed in these cases.</p>

          <p> was our Shaykh, the chief of ministers, the learned and worthy Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd
            al-Raḥīm b. ʿAlī b. Ḥāmid, known as al-Dakhwār. He was — may Allāh have mercy upon him —
            unique among his generation, peerless in his time, the most learned scholar of his
            epoch, the apogee of medical skill and knowledge, both general and specialized. No one
            matched him in diligence or learning. He tired himself out with work, straining his mind
            in order to gain knowledge, until he surpassed all contemporary physicians and won more
            remuneration and honor from kings than any doctor had ever before. He was born in
            Damascus and brought up there by his father, ʿAlī b. Ḥāmid, a famous oculist, whose
            other <pb n="902" ed="kopf"/> son, Ḥāmid b. ʿAlī, took up the same profession. At first,
            Muhadhdhab al-Dīn was also an oculist, but at the same time he worked as a copyist. His
            calligraphy was outstanding. He transcribed many books, of which I have seen a hundred
            or more, dealing with medicine and other sciences. He worked for the al-Shaykh Tāj al-Dīn
            al-Kindī Abū al-Yaman, but constantly endeavored to increase his knowledge by reading
            and memorizing — a habit he kept up until old age.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of his medical career, he was introduced to al-Makī's teachings by
            the Shaīkh Radī al-Dīn al-Rahbī — may Allāh have mercy upon him — and then became a
            close associate of Mūwafaq al-Dīn b. al-Mutrān, for whom he worked and from whom he
            learnt the art of medicine. He continued to seek out his company and study his books
            until he became expert. Afterwards Fakhr al-Dīn al-Mardīnī, who came to Damascus in the
            year 579/1189, instructed him to part of Ibn Sīnā's ʿQānūn," which Fakhr al-Dīn knew and
            comprehended thoroughly.</p>
          <p>Muhadhdhab al-Dīn worked as a physician to al-Malik al-ʿAdil Abū Bakr b. Ayyūb. This
            was because at the beginning of his career he was interested in eye diseases and wished
            to gain practice in their treatment. He worked as an oculist in <pb ed="mueller-1884" edRef="https://github.com/usaybia/usaybia-data/blob/master/data/texts/tei/IU-sample.xml" n="2.240"/>the Great Hospital
            established by al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr al-Dīn Maḥmūd b. Zankī. Later, when he worked with
            al-Mutrān and had become noted for his medical skill, Safī al-Dīn b. Shakr, the vizier
            of al-Malik al-ʿAdil b. Ayyūb, granted him an allowance, by means of which he was able to
            practice work and at the same time increase his knowledge and proficiency. </p>

          <p> He was tireless in the service of the vizier, and the latter, knowing Muhadhadhab's
            professional merits, preferred him to all others. In the month of Shawwal, 604/1207,
            al-Malik al-ʿĀdil said to Ibn Shakr: "We want another doctor besides Muwaffaq al-Dīn
            ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz for attending the troops. This work is not congenial to <pb n="903"
              ed="kopf"/> ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz, so do as he requests." Said b. Shakr: "We have here an
            excellent physician, named Muhadhdhab al-Dakhwār, who is fit for our master's service."
            Then he ordered him to comply. When Muhadhdhab al-Dīn appeared before the vizier, the
            latter said to him: "I have recommended you to the Sultan, and you are paid a month for
            your services." But Muhadhdhab al-Dīn said: "My lord: The Doctor Muwaffaq al-Dīn ʿAbd
            al-ʿAzīz earns about a hundred dinars monthly.</p>

          <p>I know my status, and I will not serve without a decent wage. Then he took leave of the
            vizier and refused the post. But his companions made him regret his refusal, his lost
            chance to be engaged by the vizier. For his salary at the hospital was very low.</p>
          <p>About that time, Muwaffaq ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz was stricken with severe colitis, which grew
            worse and eventually caused his death. When the news of his passing reached al-Malik
            al-ʿAdil, the latter said to the vizier: "You once recommended to us a doctor by the
            name of Muhadhdhab. Appoint him in place of Muwaffad ʿAbd al-ʿAziz. "So Muhadhdhab got
            all his posts, and he remained in the service of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil from then on. He rose
            steadily in al-Malik al-ʿĀdil's esteem, and his status was enhanced, until he became his
            companion, associate and adviser. At the beginning of his service, al-Malik put his
            knowledge to some unusual tests, and the results strengthened his opinion of him and his
            reliance upon him.</p>
          <p>About that time, al-Malik al-ʿĀdil fell ill. He was attended by the best doctors.
            Muhadhdhab advised bloodletting but the other physicians present did not agree. He said:
            "By Allāh! If we let blood from him, he will bleed without our being able to staunch
            it." But they were still obstinate. Very soon the Sultan began to bleed heavily. When he
            was well again, he realized that Muhadhdhab outshone all the others. <pb n="904"
              ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>Another story has it that one day, when he was standing at the palace gate with some
            court physicians, a servant came out with a vial containing the urine of one of the
            concubines and reported that she was in pain. When the doctors had inspected the vial,
            they ventured a diagnosis. But Muhadhdhab examined it closely and said: "The pain she
            complains of does not cause this color," suspecting it to be induced by Lawsonia with
            which she had anointed herself. The servant told him that his finding was correct,
            marvelled at him and reported the incident to al-Malik al-ʿĀdil; this increased the
            latter's confidence in Muhadhdhab.</p>
          <p>One of the best anecdotes about Shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn, and one that illustrates his
            savoir-faire and loyalty, is the following which was told my by my father. Once,
            al-Malik al-ʿĀdil was very angry with the chief judge, Muhyī al-Dīn b. Zakī al-Dīn, of
            Damascus. He ordered him to be detained in the fortress, demanded from him the sum of
            10,000 Egyptian dinars and pressed for payment. Muhyī al-Dīn was to remain in prison
            until the amount was settled. He paid some of the money, but was unable to raise the
            balance. Al-Malik al-ʿĀdil was inexorable, saying: "He must pay the rest, otherwise I
            shall deal very harshly with him." The judge was in dire straits. He sold all his
            possessions — his household effects, and <pb ed="mueller-1884" edRef="https://github.com/usaybia/usaybia-data/blob/master/data/texts/tei/IU-sample.xml" n="2.241"/> even his books. Then he wrote letters to the
            Sultan, using the good offices of many leading personalities, such as al-Shamīs, the
            court teacher, and Shams al-Khawās the vizier, asking for the remission of part of the
            amount or to be allowed to pay in installments. But the Sultan remained adamant, and as
            a result, the judge was so worried that he hardly ate or slept and thus almost killed
            himself. At this point, his old friend Muhadhdhab al-Dīn paid him a visit. The judge
            told Muhadhdhab al-Dīn his troubles, begging him to do what he could. After some
            consideration, al-Muhadhdhab said: "I shall do something for you. I hope that, God
            willing, it will be of use." Then he departed. <pb n="905" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>Serīat al-Malik al-ʿAdil, the mother of al-Malīk al-Sālih b. al-Malīk, was unwell at
            that time. She was of Turkish origin, an intelligent, pious and good woman, very kind
            and generous. When the Doctor Muhadhdhab al-Dīn came to see her in the harem, he
            acquainted her with the case of the judge, his troubles and the unjust treatment meted
            out to him — i.e., that he was being asked to do the impossible — and requested that she
            intervene: perhaps the Sultan could show mercy to him and remit part of the debt or let
            him pay it in installments. The chief eunuch supported Muhadhdhab request. But Seriat
            said: "How can I do anything for the judge, or even mention him to the Sultan? I cannot,
            because he will ask: 'What makes you speak about the judge, and how is it that you know
            him?' If we were, say, a doctor who visits us from time to time, or a merchant who sells
            us cloth, it would be possible for me to talk and intervene; but as it is, I can do
            nothing." When Muhadhdhab heard this, he said: "My lady! You have an only son, whom you
            wish happiness and a long life. Now, you can obtain this for him from Allāh by doing
            something without actually intervening with the Sultan at all." Said she: "And what is
            that?" Said he: "When the Sultan and you sleep together, tell him you have dreamt that
            the judge is being treated unjustly"; and he told her what to say. She thereupon said,
            "It can be done."</p>
          <p>One night, when she was well again and the Sultan was sleeping with her, as the night
            was ending, she pretended to be frightened, clutched at her heart and kept shivering and
            crying. The Sultan, who loved her dearly, noticed it and said: "What is the matter with
            you?" But she did not reply. He then ordered some apple juice to be brought and had her
            drink some, sprinkled her face with rose water and said: "Will you not tell me what has
            happened to you, why you are so upset?" She said: "O Master, I have had a dream which
            almost frightened to death. I dreamt that it was Doomsday and saw a large crowd of <pb
              n="906" ed="kopf"/> people. In one place, where there was a great fire, people were
            saying: "This had been prepared for al-Malīk al-ʿĀdil because of the injustice he did to
            the judge." Then she said: "Have you ever done anything to the judge?" And he, who did
            not doubt her story, became troubled, rose early, called his servants and said to them:
            "Go to the judge and make him happy: give him my regards, ask him to forgive me and tell
            him that all he has paid will be returned to him. As for me, I will ask nothing of him."
            So they went to him. The judge was very pleased with their announcement, blessed the
            Sultan and forgave him. In the same morning the Sultan ordered that he be given a suit
            of clothes and a mule. He restored him to his office and ordered that all the books and
            other possessions he had sold be redeemed from the purchasers for the same amount as
            they had paid. Thus relief was brought to the judge after anguish, by minimum effort and
            the subtlest of tactics.</p>
          <p>In the year 610/1213, when he was in the east, al-Malīk al-ʿĀdil became very ill, and
            Muhadhdhab al-Dīn treated him until he was cured. During that illness, the king paid the
            physician 7,000 Egyptian dinars. In addition, the king's children, some eastern kings
            and others sent him gold, suits of clothes, mule carts, gold neckbands and other
            items.</p>
          <p>A similar event occurred in the year <pb ed="mueller-1884" n="2.242"> </pb> 612/1215, when al-Malīk al-Ādil went to Egypt and
            stayed in Cairo. At that time, a dreadful cholera epidemic killed many people. Among
            those stricken was al-Malīk al-Kāmil b. al-Maīlk al-ʿĀdil, who was the Governor of
            Egypt. Muhadhdhab al-Dīn treated him most solicitously until he became well again. This
            time, Muhadhdhab al-Dīn received 12,000 dinars' worth of gold, besides many suits of
            clothes and other splendid gifts, including fourteen mules carrying golden rings and a
            great deal of satin and other kinds of cloth. <pb n="907" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>About that time, the Sultan appointed Muhadhdhab al-Dīn chief physician of Egypt and
            Syria. I was then with my father, who was also in the service of al-Malīk al-ʿĀdil.
            Muhadhdhab al-Dīn was in charge of ophthalmological matters; it was he who decided who
            was qualified to treat eye diseases.</p>
          <p>In the year 614/1217, having learnt of Christian maneuvers near the coast, al-Malik
            al-ʿĀdil went to Syria and stayed at Marj al-Sughr. While he was in a place called
            Manzilat al-Ālekīn, he fell ill and died, may Allāh have mercy upon him. He died in the
            second hour of Friday, the 7th day of Jumādā al-Ākhira, in the year 615/1218.</p>
          <p>When al-Malik al-Muʿazam had established his rule over Syria, he wished to employ
            several of those who had served his father, al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, among them the physician
            Rashīd al-Dīn b. al-Surī, who refused. As for Muhadhdhab al-Dīn, he gave him a salary
            and ordered him to live in Damascus, where he was to treat patients at the Great
            Hospital established by al-Malik al-ʿAdil Nūr al-Dīn b. Zankī.</p>
          <p>When Muhadhdhab al-Dīn was in Damascus, he began to teach medicine, and many of the
            best physicians joined him, besides others that studied under him. I, too, stayed in
            Damascus to learn from him (but I had first worked under him at the military camp where
            my father and he served the great Sultan). I would visit him as one of a group of
            students, and I began to study Galen. He was well-versed in the works of this author and
            others. He admired Galen very much, and whenever someone mentioned anything he had
            written concerning diseases and their therapy or the fundamentals of the medical
            science, he would say: "That is medicine."</p>

          <p>He was quick-witted, a clear thinker and a good conversationalist. I accompanied him on
            his rounds at the hospital, thus gaining personal experience. At that time, his
            associate was the eminent physician ʿAmrān. Later, their collaboration became less
            fruitful. <pb n="908" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>Muhadhdhab al-Dīn was a supremely able medical savant and practitioner, the exponent of
            the most effective cures known in his day. Hence he eventually gained the reputation of
            a wizard.</p>

        <div>
          <head><persName>My uncle, Rashid al-Dīn ʿĀlī b. Khalīfa.</persName></head>
          <p> Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. Khalīfa b. Yūnus b. Abī al-Qāsin b. Khalīfa, from [the tribe of]
            Kazraj, the offspring of Saīd b. ʿIbāda, was born in Aleppo in 579/1183. My father was
            born before him, in 575/1179, in Cairo the unconquerable. They both grew up in that
            city, where they also practiced. My gradfather, may he be blessed, was an ambitious man
            who greatly admired virtue and scholarship and was well-versed in the different
            sciences. He was known as Ibn Abī Usaybiʿa. He used to be in the service of al-Malik
            al-Nāsir Salah Al-Din Yūsuf b. Ayyūb and his children, and moved to Egypt when that ruler
            conquered the land. Among my grandfather's Damascene acquaintances and friends were
            Jamāl al-Dīn b. al-Hawāfir the physician and Shihāb al-Dīn Abu al-Hajjāj Yūsuf the
            oculist, for my grandfather was born and raised in Damascus, where he also spent many
            years of his life. By the time he met the two aforesaid gentlement in Egypt, my
            grandfather was already raising my father and uncle. He intended to teach them both
            medicine <pb ed="mueller-1884" n="2.247"> </pb>, in consideration of the nobleness of this profession and the demand for
            physicians, knowing that he who mastered its principles would be honored and favored in
            this world and attain the highest rank in the hereafter. </p>
          <p>So he attached my father and uncle to these two Shaykhs, in order that they might reap
            from their knowledge. My father was entrusted to Abū al-Hajjaj Yūsuf, in order to study
            ophthalmology and learn its practice. Abū al-Hajjāj was then serving as an oculist in a
            hospital in Cairo, not the one situated in the fort, but one located in the market
            district of lower Cairo. My grandfather used to live just by it, so it was easy for my
            father to frequent Aba al-Hajjāj Yūsuf constantly and <pb n="909" ed="kopf"/> study from
            him until he mastered his field. He also studied with other notable master-physicians
            who lived at that time in Egypt, such as the master Mūsā al-Qurtabī, the author of
            famous works, and others like him. As for my uncle, he was attached to Jamāl al-Dīn b.
            Abī al-Hawāfir and studied general medicine under him.</p>
          <p>My uncle first started his studies with Taqī the Teacher. His full name was Abū al-Taqī
            Sālih b. Aḥmad b. Ibrāhīm b. al-Ḥasan b. Sulaymān from the tribe of Quraish, the
            Jerusalemite. This Taqī was adept in many sciences, had a fine way of teaching in school
            and a celebrated system which no one else could follow. After my uncle, may he be
            blessed, had learned the Qu'rān by heart and perfected his mathematics, all under Taqī,
            he started to study medicine thoroughly under the direction of Jamāl al-Dīn b. Abī
            al-Hawāfir, who was then chief physician of Egypt, under the rule of al-Malik al-ʿAzīz
            ʿOthmān, the son of al-Malik al-Nāsir Salāh al-Dīn. He studied with him parts of Galen's
            Sixteen Books, memorizing the whole of the first ones in the shortest time possible. He
            then joined the physicians in their consultations and their rounds of the patients in
            the hospital, learning the different maladies</p>

          <p>and the appropriate prescriptions. (There was a group of very notable physicians at the
            hospital.) At the same time he studied ophthalmology with the judge Nafīs al-Dīn b.
            al-Zubair, who was then head of the department in the hospital, and started to practice
            it. He also joined him in initiating a surgical department.</p>
          <p>The Shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Latīf b. Yūsuf the Baghdadian, an intimate friend of
            my grandfather's was staying in Cairo at the time. My uncle studied a little Arabic and
            philosophy with him and they used to discuss Aristotle's books, debating the difficult
            points. My uncle also used to meet and study with Sadīd al-Dīn the Logician, who was a
            great scholar in the philosophical sciences. Before that, he had studied astronomy under
            Abī Muḥammad b. al-Jaʿdī, an expert <pb n="910" ed="kopf"/> astronomer who was
            celebrated for his judgments. This shaykh lived at the time of the Egyptian caliphs and
            was considered a favorite of theirs; his father was one of the chief emirs of their
            state.</p>
          <p>The art of music my uncle studied under the guidance of Ibn al-Dīgūr the Egyptian and
            Safī al-Dīn Abī ʿAlī b. al-Tabbān. He also knew the elite in this field, such as
            al-Bahā; the great composer, Shihāb al-Dīn al-Naqjūnī, Shujāʿ al-Dīn b. al-Ḥasan the
            Baghdadian and their equals, from which he learnt many Arabic and other melodies. From
            his youth, my uncle devoted all his leisure to study, work and the betterment of his
            soul.</p>
          <p>My grandfather moved back to Syria in 597/1200, when my uncle was about twenty years
            old. He immediately took up practicing medicine and improving his knowledge of it.
            Shaykh Radīʿ al-Dīn Yūsuf b. Haīdara from Rahba, an old friend of my grandfather's, was
            then staying in Damascus. <pb ed="mueller-1884" n="2.248"> </pb>When he heard of my uncle, saw him at work and realized his virtues, he was happily surprised. My uncle constantly visited his court, studied and
            discussed medical matters with him. He worked in the hospital built by al-Malik al-ʿAdil Nūr al-Dīn b. Zankī, together with other physicians who were there at the time, such as
            Muwaffaq al-Dīn b. al-Saraf and Shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm b. ʿAlī. Meanwhile he also studied philosophy under Shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn Abd al-Latīf b. Yūsuf
            the Baghdadian, for he too had returned to Syria. There was in Damascus a group of men celebrated for their literary achievements and knowledge of Arabic, such as Zaīn al-Dīn
            b. Muʿtī, with whom my uncle studied and practiced, and Tāj al-Dīn Zaid b. al-Ḥasan al-Kindī Abī al-Yaman, who was an old and intimate friend of my grandfather's since the
            days of ʿIz al-Dīn Farukhshāh. My uncle studied with him too and practiced his Arabic. <pb n="911" ed="kopf"/></p>
          <p>Before my uncle was twenty-five years old, he had already mastered all these sciences,
            becoming an exemplary shaykh in medicine and having his own disciples. He was also
            writing poems and responsa, spoke Persian, knowing all its rules and even composing
            poetry in it, and knew Turkish as well. On Friday the 15th of Ramadān, 605/1208, the
            Sultan al-Malik al-Muʿazzam ʿĪsā b. al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr b. Āyyūb called for him.
            Having conversed with him, he honored and favored him and asked him to stay in his
            service, but difficulties arose because of the Sultan's frequent travels. Some time
            later, al-Malik al-Amjad Majd al-Dīn Bahrām Shah b. ʿIzz al-Dīn Farūkhshāh b. Shāhinshāh
            b. ʿAyyūb, the governor of Baʿalbekk, heard of him and sent for him and my grandfather,
            whom he had known since his father's time. When they both arrived, he welcomed them,
            treated them most generously and allotted them a good salary, expenses and a high rank.
            In consequence, my uncle's position with him became so favorable that he hardly left him
            at all. The governor then became aware of my uncle's mastery of arithmetic and asked him
            to be his teacher in this field. In obedience to this order, my uncle instructed the
            governor thoroughly in this science and even compiled for his use a textbook comprising
            four treatises. Al-Malik al- 'Amjad himself, may Allāh bless him, was a virtuous man who
            showed keen respect to the learned; he wrote fine poetry, including a famous
            authology.</p>
          <p>In the year 609/1212, a dear servant of the Sultan al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr b. Ayyūb,
            called Sulaita, became afflicted with an eye disease. His condition was so bad that his
            sight was diminished and his case considered hopeless. All the best physicians and
            oculists tried to treat him, but none could cure him; so they decided unanimously that
            he would be blind, as no treatment had any effect whatsoever. When my father saw this
            man and examined his eyes, he said; "I will treat this man's eyes and he will see with
            both of them, if God so wishes." He started to treat him, and his condition steadily
            improved, until his recovery was complete. He returned <pb n="912" ed="kopf"/> to his
            former self and was able to ride a horse again, so that everyone was astonished and
            regarded the cure as an unrivaled miracle. In consequence, al-Malik al- Ādil's
            generosity and consideration toward my father increased greatly, and he paid him the
            utmost honor by presenting him with precious robes, etc.</p>
          <p>Even before this event, my father quite frequently, used to visit the Sultan's palace
            in the fort of Damascus, treating those who were afflicted with serious eye diseases and
            curing them in the shortest time conceivable. This also came to the knowledge of
            al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, who said; "Such a man should accompany me wherever I go!" and asked
            him to join his service. My father requested to be excused and given permission to stay
            in Damascus, but this was not granted. The Sultan granted him a salary and expenses, and
            my father enrolled in his service on the 15th of Dhū al-Hijja 609/1212. He was a
            favorite of his and of all his sons and successors, who relied upon him in all medical
            matters and <pb ed="mueller-1884" n="2.249"> </pb> treated him with great generosity and perfect deference. He remained in
            service until the death of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, may he be blessed, when he was asked to
            continue in his post by the son and successor in Damascus, al-Malik al-Muʿazam. The
            latter treated him with the same honor and esteem, or even more, as his father had done.
            My father served him from the beginning of Safar 616/1219 until he died, may Allāh have
            mercy upon him, and then was asked by his son, al-Malik al-Nāsir Da'ūd, to stay in his
            service too, promising him all the rights he had enjoyed formerly. My father remained
            until al-Malik al-Nāsir had to leave for Karak, at which point my father chose to stay
            in Damascus.</p>
          <p>He started frequenting the Sultan's palace in the fort, attending all the descendants
            of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil who succeeded him in Damascus and others as well. All revered him
            highly, relied upon him in all medical matters and allotted him a generous salary and
            expenses. He also used to frequent the Great Hospital named after <pb n="913" ed="kopf"
            /> Nur al-Dīn, where he was also remunerated. People used to come to him from every
            quarter, having heard of his rapid cures. The many maladies which were wont to be cured
            by the iron he treated thus to perfection. For other diseases habitually treated by
            drugs he indeed applied drugs, saving the afflicted from the use of the iron. This
            method was praised by Galen in his book "The Test of the Virtuous Physician," saying:
            "Whenever you see a physician administering drugs in the case of maladies which are
            usually treated with the iron, know that he is learned, experienced and skilled." He
            adds: "You should also praise the physician whom you see using drugs exclusively against
            those eye diseases for which others usually employ the scalpel, i.e., cataract, scabies,
            cold, water, opacity, growth, stye, excess or loss of flesh in the interior angle of the
            eye; you should also praise the physician whom you see promptly extract from the eye a
            collection of matter, by lowering the layer called "the grape-like" back to its place
            after it has become very swollen, until it is healed again, or perform any other
            ophthalmological operation which is similar to the above, without having recourse to the
            iron." So much for Galen's remarks.</p>
          <p>I have indeed witnessed many such cases in my father's treatments and also many eye
            diseases which were considered hopeless but which he succeeded in curing. This was
            celebrated in a poem written by one of his grateful patients, namely Shams al-Ārab,
            i.e., Abū Muḥammad Abd al-Aziz b. al-Nafīs b. Hibat Allāh b. Wahbān al-Silamī, the
            Baghdadian:</p>
          <quote><p><l>Sadīd al-Dīn has such a power in medicine, that he always saves the eyes from
                mote; </l><l> How often has he banished darkness and guarded the sight from all
                harm;</l><l> An oculist cannot treat mankind unless he is as skillful as this;
                </l><l> O savior of our generation! How many are those to whom you have given sight
                after being blind; <pb n="914" ed="kopf"/>
              </l><l> Your science is the cure to every malady, your words the balm of every
                spirit;</l><l> My gratitude is so great, I wish I could express the least of my
                thanks, O beloved!</l></p></quote>
          <p>My father remained in service in the fort of Damascus and frequented the al-Nurī
            Hospital until he died, may he be blessed, during the night of Thursday, the 22nd of
            Rabīʿ II, 649/1251. He was buried outside the Gate of Paradise, on the way to Mount
            Qāsiyūn. He died during the reign of al-Malik al-Nāsir Yūsuf b. Muḥammad, the ruler of
            Damascus. As for my uncle, he was staying with al-Malik al-Amjad in Baʿlbek when
            al-Malik al-Muʿazam came there to help him fight his adversaries. When they met
            together, my uncle would keep them company. Now during those days, there was nobody who
            knew music and the art of the lute better than him, neither was there anyone with a
            sweeter voice, so that he touched the souls of his listeners in the same fashion as Abū
            Nasr al-Fārābī, according to what was said. Al-Malik al-Muʿazam was greatly impressed
            by him and engaged him in his service, which post he took up on the 1st of Jumiādā I,
            610/1213, receiving a fine salary and expenses.</p>
          <p>Al-Malik al-Muʿazzam showered on my uncle constant favors and presents; he hardly left
            him and relied on him for anything medical. The same can be said for al-Malik al-Kāmil
            Muḥammad and al-Malik al-Ashraf, who both had absolute confidence in him. Whenever one
            of them came to visit his brother al -Malik al-Muʿazam, my uncle would keep them
            constant company and obtain many presents from both rulers. I know of one occasion, when
            al-Malik al-Kāmil came to visit his brother al-Malik al-Muʿazam; they were sitting in
            audience in the company of my uncle; that same night, al-Malik al-Kāmil gave my uncle a
            splendid robe of honor and five hundred Egyptian dinars. <pb n="915" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>When al-Malik al-Muʿazam was in Damascus, he appointed my uncle military scribe,
            insisting on his acceptance of the post. My uncle could do nothing but obey this order,
            sat on the Divan and received the privates and officers. After a while in his
            secretarial post, he realized that all his time was spent in correspondence and
            calculations, with no leisure left for himself to devote to intellectual and other
            pursuits. He thus asked the Sultan to be released, using the mediation of several of his
            intimates, until he was finally granted his request.</p>
          <p>In the year 611/1214 al-Malik al-Muʿazam made the pilgrimage [to Mecca] and my uncle
            went with him. He stayed in his service until the expedition of ʿAmta, in the middle of
            Shaban, 614/1217. The Franks having advanced, the great Sultan al-Malik al-ʿĀdil and his
            son al-Malik al-Muʿazam fell into disagreement as to the route which should be
            followed. My uncle joined the company of al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, who went in the direction of
            Damascus, while al-Malik al-Muʿazam turned toward Nablus. Later, my uncle left Damascus
            In the company of al-Malik al-Nāsir Dā'ūd b. al-Malik al-Muʿazam, but arriving at
            ʿIglun, he [al-Malik al-Muʿazam] ordered his son to come back, and they all returned to
            Damascus. My uncle then fell ill; his affliction continued for the rest of the year, and
            he found that traveling was injurious to him; in fact, by nature he was inclined to
            solitude and the peaceful study of books.</p>
          <p>On the 5th of Muharram, 615/1218 he was summoned by al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr b.
            Ayyūb, who had heard of his achievements and perfect conduct. He assigned him the post
            of chief physician in the two hospitals of Damascus built by al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Nūr
            al-Dīn Mahmud b. Zenkī. From then on, he used to frequent these two hospitals and the
            fort, enjoying a salary and expenses. He was also paid as the personal physician of Sitt
            al-Sā'am, the sister of al-Malik al-ʿAdil, whom he would attend at her palace. <pb
              n="916" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>Having settled in Damascus, he established a public school where he could teach
            medicine. He had many disciples, all of them later to be distinguished members of the
            profession. At that time he used to meet with ʿAlam al-Dīn Qaisar b. Abū al-Qāsim b.
            ʿAbd al-Gānī, who was unique in his generation for his knowledge of the mathematical
            sciences. My uncle studied astronomy under him and became an expert in no time. One day,
            when ʿAlam al-Dīn was at my uncle's house teaching him some astronomical figures, he
            said to him in my presence: "O, Rashīd al-Dīn, by Allāh, what you have learnt in about
            one month would take others five years of effort to master."</p>
          <p>While in Damascus, my uncle also used to frequent the illustrious and learned Imām, the
            Shaykh of shaykhs, Sadr al-Din b. Hamawaihi. This person initiated him to Sufism on the
            20th of Ramadān, 615/1218. The following is the text of the inscription attached to his
            sufi garment, in which he was clad on that day: "In the name of Allāh the Merciful and
            Compassionate; the illustrious Mollah, noble and learned Imām, Shaykh of shaykhs, Sadr
            al-Dīn, the living proof of Islam and standard of monotheism, Abū al-Ḥasan Muḥammad, the
            son of the illustrious Imam and noble scholar, Shaykh of shaykhs Imad al-Dīn Abū Hafs
            ʿUmar b. Abū al-Ḥasan b. Muḥammad b. Hamawaih, may God maintain his support forever,
            herewith endows kindly <pb ed="mueller-1884" n="2.[250]"></pb> his devotee ʿAlī b. Halīfa b. Yūnus from the tribe of Chazrag the
            Damascene, may Allāh make him succeed in his devotions, with the Sufi garment."</p>
          <p>While dressing him in it, the shaykh told my uncle that he had received that robe from
            his above-mentioned father, may he be blessed, and that his father had gotten it from
            his father, the shaykh of Islam Muʿīn al-Dīn Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad b. Hamawaih, may
            Allāh bless him. He was given it by the prophet Elijah, may he rest in peace, who in
            turn received it from the Apostle of God himself, may Allāh bless him and give him
            peace. The shaykh added that his grandfather was connected to the Prophet also by
            shaykh of his generation <pb n="917" ed="kopf"/> Abū al-Qāsim al-Karakānī, the master
            and Imām Abū ʿUthmān al-Maġribi; the shaykh of the community ʿAbd ʿAmru al-Zajājī; the
            another chain of celebrated sufīs, that is: Shaykh Abū ʿAlī al-Farandi al-Tūsī, the
            chief ofthe congregation al-Jūnaīd b. Muḥammad; his maternal uncle Sarī al-Saqatī;
            Maʿrūf al-Karhī. ʿAlī b. Mūsā al-Rida, may he be blessed (this Maʿrūf accompanied ʿAlī b.
            Mūsā, served him and was instructed by him); Mūsā b. Jaʿfar al-Kāzim; Jaʿfar b. Muḥammad
            al-Sadīq; Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Bāqir; ʿAlī b. al-Husain Zain al-ʿĀbidīn; al-Husain b.
            ʿAlī; ʿAlī al-Bāqir; ʿAlī b. al-Ḥusayn Zain al-ʿĀbidīn; al-Ḥusayn b. ʿAlī(W) al-Bāqir:
            ʿAlī Talib, may he be blessed; ʿAlī, may Allāh honor his countenance, was directly
            connected with the master of the apostles and Imām of the pious believers, our prophet
            Muḥammad, may the best prayers and and wishes rest upon him. According to yet another
            version, the tradition goes from Maʿrūf through Da'ūd al-Tā'i, Habīb al-ʿAgamī, Hasan
            al-Basrī the leader of the followers, to ʿAlī, may he be blessed, and then to the
            Prophet, may Allāh bless him and give him peace.</p>
          <p>The endowment of my uncle with such a robe brought upon him all of God's incumbent
            blessings, as it did upon all those who had been honored by it. This event took place on
            the 20th of Ramadān, 615/ 1218 in Damascus the well-protected. The robe was thrown on
            the aforesaid, may Allāh lead him to success, accompanied by the above-quoted lines,
            written by the hand of the Mollah Sadr al-Dīn, the Shaykh of shaykhs, Ibn Hamawaih Abū
            al-Ḥasan b. ʿUmar b. Abū al-Ḥasan b. Muḥammad, who wrote them during the month of
            Ramadān, 615/ 1218, praising God and praying for his apostle, asking pardon for his
            sins.</p>
          <p>In the year 616/1219 my uncle received a message from al-Malik al-Sālih ʿIsmāʿīl b.
            al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, in his own handwriting, asking him to come to the town of Bosrā and
            treat his mother and other sick persons who were staying with him; afterward he could
            return to Damascus. Indeed a great epidemic was raging in Bosrā <pb n="918" ed="kopf"/>
            at the time, My uncle went to Bosrā, cured the sultan's mother in the shortest time
            possible and was presented with gold and honorary robes. While in Bosrā, he was stricken
            with an acute fever, which grew steadily worse, even after his return to Damascus. He
            was treated there by the best physicians, but his term had come. He died, may Allāh have
            mercy upon him, in the second hour of Monday, the 17th of Shaban, 616/1219, at the age
            of 38. He was buried near his father and brother outside the Gate of Paradise.</p>
          <p>The following are some of his aphorisms, as I heard them from him, may his soul rest in
            peace:</p>
          <p>1. "The commandment of the early morning is to face the new day, in which you are
            capable of doing all manner of things, with the resolution to perform the finest deeds,
            such as would lead you to the highest of ranks; you have to do good, for it will bring
            you closer to God and endear you to mem, beware of evil, for it will estrange you from
            God and make people hate you. Do what would give you credit in the soul-reckoning at the
            end of the day; do not let the evil part of your nature overpower the good that is in
            you. A noble man is not he who retains his natural purity by the absence of obstacles,
            but rather he who retains it in spite of obstacles; the best way to shun these obstacles
            is to retreat into seclusion from the world.</p>
          <p>Follow the prophets' testaments and emulate the deeds of the wise.</p>
          <p>Speak the truth, for a lie belittles a man in his own eyes even more than in the eyes
            of others.</p>
          <p>Be patient and you will be thanked and honored, for hatred brings anguish and leads to
            enmity and evil, just as envy does.</p>
          <p>Avoid evil men and you will spare yourself their harm;</p>
          <p>Avoid the rulers of this world and you will spare yourself the company of evil men, <pb
              n="919" ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>Accept from this world only what is essential for your physical needs.</p>

          <p>Know that this your day is a piece of your life gone forever, so spend it on something
            which might benefit you later; after having satisfied the needs of your body, dedicate
            the rest of your day to the perfection of your soul. Do unto people as you would like
            them to do unto you. Beware of anger and of haste to take revenge on an angry man or to
            be affected by him; for in most cases it would lead to repentence; you should be
            patient, for patience is the mainstay of all wisdom."</p>
          <p>2. "The commandment of the early night is to face this coming night in which you have
            no pressing physical duty to fulfill, with the resolution to work on the improvement of
            your soul, by studying the sciences, by meditating on the knowledge of truth; as long as
            you can stay awake, do this; when you feel yourself falling asleep, fix your soul to the
            subject of your concern, so that your dreams may also be of the same nature. Do what
            would give you credit in the soul-reckoning of the following morning.</p>

          <p>Endeavor to be a better person tomorrow than you were yesterday.</p>
          <p>Beware of being entrained by your nature to ponder on what you have seen during the day
            of the conditions of worldly people, for by this you will waste your time, open for
            yourself the gates of deception, trickery and guile in order to achieve worldly matters,
            corrupt your soul and spoil your position, drawing away from truths and acquiring those
            shameful characteristics which are so difficult to cast off. Know that these [worldly
            matters] are transient and useless accidents, that the needs of man are indeed very
            few.</p>

          <p>Think only of the things which might be useful to you and prepare yourself to meet
            Allāh, for the knowledge of when you will die is <pb n="920" ed="kopf"/> concealed from
            you, although your wish to stay alive another day is stronger than your fear to die this
            same night; so you should be reconciled to persevere in those things which might benefit
            you after your departure. Dixi."</p>
          <p>3. "Respect the shaykhs, even though they may not answer your questions, for their
            silence might be broken later; perhaps it was due to weariness, or to the fact that it
            was none of your business, or to their knowledge of your incapability of understanding
            the answer; keep in mind that the benefit you might derive from them is incomparably
            greater than any particular answer."</p>
          <p>4. "First of all, study the general sayings of the famous; after having mastered these,
            you can go on to study the particular sayings of each person as contained in their
            book."</p>

          <p>5. Consider the sayings of each person objectively, without love or hatred; then weigh
            them according to the rules and examine them by experiment, if possible; only then can
            you accept the truth in them. In case this is too difficult for you, enlist someone's
            aid, for each mind has a special capacity for interpreting certain meanings."</p>
          <p>6. "If you are pushed forth by virtuous people, go forth, for if you do not, you will
            lag behind."</p>

            al-Raḥmān b. Ibrāhīm was the son of the Judge of Baʿalbekk. He grew up in Damascus,
            where he studied medicine. An indescribable amount of precious knowledge, extreme
            intelligence and manly valor was. imbued into his soul by God the Omnipotent. He studied
            medicine under our master the physician Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm b. ʿAlī, may he
            be blessed, and within the shortest possible time reached to perfection in both its
            theoretical and practical aspects. He was highly ambitious in his work and his soul
            contained all virtues I found him to study with a conscientiousness unmatched by any of
            the other students, for he never ceased to increase his knowledge, improve his
            scholarship and deepen his understanding. He knew many medical books and philosophical
            works by heart. The following story, to which I myself was a witness, may serve as proof
            of his high ambition and fine character. The shaykh Muhadhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm ʿAlī
            had composed a treatise on vomiting. Each of his disciples studied it with him but Badr
            al-Dīn learnt it by heart and recited it from memory, without referring to the text,
            from beginning to end. For this the shaykh esteemed him highly. Our physician was
            attached to this shaykh, assiduously reading and studying under his guidance.</p>
          <p>In the year 622/1225, when Shaykh Muhadhdhab al-Dīn traveled to the East in order to
            join the service of al-Malik al-Ashraf Mūsā b. al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, he was accompanied by
            Badr al-Dīn, who continued to study with him. Later, Badr al-Dīn worked at the hospital
            of al-Raqqa and composed a fine treatise on the weather, conditions and predominant
            characteristics of this locality. He stayed in al-Raqqa for many years and studied
            philosophy under Zain al-Dīn the blind, may he be blessed, who was a master in the <pb
              n="931" ed="kopf"/> philosophical sciences. He then returned to Damascus, When
            al-Malik al-Gawād Muzaffar al-Dīn Yūnus b. Shams al-Dīn Mamdūd b. al-Malik al-ʿĀdil
            conquered Damascus in the year 635/1237, he called Badr al-Dīn to his service. The
            latter became a favorite, enjoying an important position in the government. The Sultan
            relied upon him in all medical matters and appointed him chief of all the physicians,
            oculists and surgeons, to which effect he gave him a written <pb ed="mueller-1884" n="2.[259]"></pb>
            certificate in the month of Safar 637/1239.</p>
          <p>Badr al-Dīn revived the long-forgotten virtues of medicine and instilled new life into
            its neglected merits by his continuous desire for doing good and his ceaseless concern
            for the general weal. The achievement which I now relate is the one I find the most
            beneficial, having the most long-lasting effect and gaining him the highest deserved
            reward: He expended all his efforts to buy many houses adjacent to the Great Hospital
            built and provided for [by mortmains] by al-Malik al-ʿAdil Nūr al-Dīn Mahmud b. Zenkī,
            may Allāh bless him; he worked hard for this and paid for it with his own money, until
            he annexed these houses to the hospital and incorporated them into it. He enlarged small
            rooms in order that they might serve as wards for the sick, reconstructed them in the
            best way, plastered them and installed running water in them, so that the hospital was
            improved by this most noble deed.</p>
          <p>Still he did not give up teaching medicine and also served as a physician in the fort
            of Damascus, at the "happy palace," treating the royal family of al-Malik al-Sālāh Najm
            al-Dīn Ayyūb b. al-Malik al-Kāmil and others who took refuge there, frequenting the
            hospital from time to time and practicing there as well. This ruler also gave him a
            written certificate, appointing him head physician, in the year 645/1247. Badr al-Dīn
            also attended several of his successors in Damascus, enjoying a permanent salary, a
            stable rank, an important position and the highest favors, while he went on visiting the
            fort and the hospital, increasing his knowledge in his leisure time. <pb n="932"
              ed="kopf"/>
          </p>
          <p>The following story may illustrate his high ambition and nobility of soul. He devoted
            himself to the science of religious law, spending much of his time in a room in the
            madrassa named Qiligiya, which was built by the Emir Saīf al-Dīn b. Qilij, may he be
            blessed, which was adjacent to his house. He studied books on jurisprudence and the
            literary arts, learnt the Qur'ān by heart to perfection and came to know its
            commentaries and modes of reading so well that he was considered an authority in the
            field. His master was the shaykh and Imām Shihāb al-Dīn Abū Shama, may Allāh bless him.
            Badr al-Dīn's sole interest lay in worship and religion and in being of assistance to
            other muslims.</p>
          <p>The fame of his nobility, generosity and kindness was continuously reaching my ears,
            until one of his works, a book entitled "The Soul-Cheerer" fell into my hands. I then
            wrote to him concerning the epistle "The Pious Bequest of a Mamluk," written by our
            master the physician and learned Imam Badr al-Dīn, may God strengthen his happiness and
            prolong his leadership, and contained in his unrivaled book in his concise style, called
            "The Soul-Cheerer, the originator of joy and happiness." In this book he surpassed
            former scholars, preceded all other physicians and philosophers, liberated anguished
            hearts and became the unquestionable leader in his lofty rank, with nobody to vie for
            his perfection and mastership. He is our lord, the shaykh of our times and the example
            of our generation. May God render his life full of happiness and fill the earth with his
            writings, so that many will be able to benefit by them!</p>
          <p>In the same epistle I included the following verses, addressed to him
            extemporaneously:</p>
          <quote><p><l>The rising sun was almost eclipsed by the radiance of Badr al-Dīn,</l><l> A

            tree.</l></p></quote>
          <p>I included the following verses in another epistle . . . . . . . . . . </p>
          <p>May God prolong the life of his majesty the illustrious master, the learned scholar,
            the honorable leader, the standard of our generation and unique one of our times, the
            full moon of religion [Badr al-Dīn], the support of kings and sultans, an intimate
            friend of the Emir of the Faithful and the guardian of his virtues. May God accord him,
            in both this world and the next, the fulfillment of all his desires; may he cast down
            all his envious enemies; may happiness reside always in his home and may tongues never
            cease singing his praise in harmony. The mamluk [Ibn Abū Usaybiʿah uses this term here
            in reference to himself] ends [his <pb n="934" ed="kopf"/> epistle] by expressing his
            great longing to serve Badr al-Dīn. Had he the eloquence of the master shaykh together
            with Galen's prosy style, he still would have been unable to describe the depth of his
            yearnings and the magnitude of his suffering because of the separation. He prays to God
            the Omnipotent to facilitate their prompt meeting and make it good and beneficial. When
            your obedient servant heard of your appointment as chief of all the physicians, which
            was a sign of God's favor to them and their salvation from all pain, he rejoiced and
            reached the summit of his desires, realizing that God has indeed looked upon his people
            with a benevolent eye and gathered them under his generous protection. [By this
            appointment] the profession was raised in importance, its light spread, its fame grew
            together with its great favor, fortune and radiant splendor. Because of him, our
            generation is ennobled by medicine more than other generations and the status of science
            is the contrary to what was described by Ibn al-Hatīb in his book "Commentary on the
            Universals." Glory be to God for his all-embracing favors and perfect kindness! But our
            master is the first to be appointed chief of the profession and leader of the other
            masters and scholars. </p>
          <quote><p><l>And it could not be so good, were it not for him; </l><l> And he could not be
                so successful, were it not for it.</l></p></quote>
          <p>[Even after his appointment] the signs of glory continued to shine through all his
            deeds and the marks of superiority proved his virtues and nobility. May God the
            Omnipotent aid him in his new post and help him in everything he does now and in the
            future, if he so wishes!"</p>
            <pb ed="mueller-1884" n="2.[261]"></pb>
          <p>The following verses are part of a poem which I addressed to him in the year
            645/1247:</p>
          <quote><p><l>I wrote with unreined passion, with an extreme delight that grew constantly
                with the passing of time; <pb n="935" ed="kopf"/>
              </l><l> With unceasing longings for him who keeps attracting my thoughts and is the
                subject of all my good wishes:</l><l> He is the master Badr al-Dīn, the noble and
                praiseworthy, in the apogee of height, unique in his generation;</l><l> A physician
                who masters all that Hippocrates had said before, and knows all that Galen said
                later;</l><l> Who is versed in the discussions of the "old master" which sound, when
                read by him, like pearls;</l><l> Indeed when these pearls of speech come from the
                sea of his learning, it is no wonder, for pearls do come from the sea;</l><l> When
                he quotes others, his words are like magic, but all sweet things come from
                magic;</l><l> When he treats a sick man and aids the poor, both his nobility and
                virtues are shown in the recovery and benevolence.</l></p></quote>
          <p>The mamluk kisses the hand of the illustrious master and scholarly physician, the noble
            chief and unrivaled leader, the hand of Badr al-Dīn, may God prolong its strength and
            generosity, may he double its favors to the good folk who deserve them and prostrate its
            grudging enemies by the duration of its happiness. May it remain in grace and perpetual
            favor, as long as the days pass into years, as long as the heart pulsates in the
            arteries. May God accord the master our best wishes as long as he still feels the breath
            of life in him; may he well reward him as long as his noble roots still expand and
            branch out; may he make his praise a continuously fragrant perfume in the gardens of
            praise; may he adorn his countenance with the perpetually shining and brilliant fame of
            his benevolence; may he fulfill all our master's passions and desires, which cannot be
            fathomed by words or put down on paper.</p>
          <p>As to the mamlūk, he relies on the master's vast knowledge, sincere love and
            friendliness and his boundless devotion to his followers and <pb n="936" ed="kopf"/>
            companions. The mamluk has received the epistle of the mamlūk's father with the good
            news, which filled his heart with joy and his soul with delight. Now he knows of the
            master's appointment as chief of all other physicians and of his protection over them by
            his good care and benevolent treatment. His father had described in his epistle the
            master's favors and generosity toward him, his kindness and nobility of spirit which are
            inherent in him and for which he is celebrated. Our master, who knows best the ways of
            honor and the fact that evil men consider the virtues as vices, should be helped by God
            to remain forever doing good, excelling in virtues, reaching the highest ranks, being
            happy and guarded against all misfortune.</p>
          <quote><p><l>This is my prayer, which I could have spared myself, for what I have asked
                God concerning you is already done.</l></p></quote>
          <p>Our master, may the high ranks be beautified by him and the elevated positions become
            even nobler by his fine opinions, has already surpassed by his virtues and nobility all
            those who are famous for their merits, has distinguished himself among all his

            specialia, and used to meet with the best physicians and greatest philosophers, from
            whom he learnt medical usages and philosophical secrets. Among them was our master the
            physician Muhadhdhab al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥīm b. ʿAlī.</p>
          <p>He also studied literature, in which he reached perfection, and Arabic. He was
            accomplished in all the literary arts and his poetry was unmatched by either the
            ancients or his contemporaries. It contained eloquent phrases and truthful meanings,
            clever puns and excellent parallels. Indeed he united in himself all the different
            sciences, and was equally masterful in poetry and prose. He was the quickest of men in
            composing poetry extempore and the most gifted in declaiming it. I witnessed him several
            times recite a poem he had composed on the spur of the moment, rich in various meanings,
            which nobody else could do, for this art was his specialty.</p>
          <p>His father, may he be blessed, was a merchant from al-Suwaīdī in the Horān, a man of
            good character, fine origins, gentle speech and noble deeds. He was a friend of my
            father's, and the <pb n="941" ed="kopf"/> ties between them were solid, intimate and
            praiseworthy. I also used to study with ʿIzz al Dīn in the same school, our master being
            Abū Bakr al-Saqalī, may he be blessed. Our old friendship remained the same in spite of
            the passing of time, and even grew steadily with it. The physician ʿIzz al-Dīn is indeed
            the most illustrious among all others with respect to his knowledge and memory,
            treatment and conversation, successful cures and precise methods. He is still practicing
            in the ʿNurī hospital, according the sick their heart's desires by banishing their
            maladies and bestowing upon them the finest gift in the form of their recovered health.
            He also used to frequent the hospital at the Postage Gate as well as in the fort of
            Damascus and was, in addition, the instructor of the Dahwāryīa. He received salaries
            from all of these four posts.</p>
          <p>ʿIzz al-Dīn copied in his own handwriting many medical books and works in other
            sciences — some of them in the script of Ibn al-Bawāb and others in the script of the
            Kufi school of Mawlid. Both his scripts were cleared than the brilliant stars and
            brighter than splendid jewels, finer than luxuriant gardens and more radiant than the
            rising sun. He told me that he had copied three versions of the Ibn Sīnā's Qānūn. In the
            year 632/1234 a merchant from Persia arrived in Damascus with a copy of 
            <pb ed="mueller-1884" n="2.[266]"></pb> Ibn Abū Sādiq's
            commentary to Galen's book "The Benefits of the Members." This copy was a correct one,
            taken from the author's manuscript, which had not been available in Syria previously. My
            father acquired it, on which occasion ʿIzz al-Dīn b. al-Suwaīdī wrote him a poem
            praising him, from which I recall the following lines:</p>
          <quote><p><l>Be praised, for you are the owner of noble and sublime things of the
                commentary on the book "The Benefits of the Members";</l><l> The lending of rare
                books is still a habit among the learned and virtuous. <pb n="942" ed="kopf"/>
              </l></p></quote>
          <p>So my father sent him the book, which was in two volumes. He made a copy of it, in the
            most beautiful handwriting and with the finest accuracy. </p>
          <p>The following are samples of his poetry, as he himself recited to me:</p>

          <p>[Concerning his worries, i.e., having to dye his hair black. . . . ] </p>
          <p>[Concerning my book on the history of physicians, known as "Important Information
            Concerning the Classes of Physicians"] . . . . </p>
          <p>[A riddle on the name ʿAlī] . . . . </p>

          <p> The learned physician and supreme literary man Imad al-Dīn Abū Abd Allāh Muḥammad, the
            son of the judge and preacher Taqi al-Dīn Abbas b. Aḥmad b. ʿUbayd al-Rabʿī, was like
            his father, a man of virtuous soul and perfect manliness, complete magnanimity and
            all-embracing generosity, great intelligence and outstanding knowledge. 
            <pb ed="mueller-1884" n="2.[267]"></pb> He was born in
            the year 605/1208 in the city of Danīsr, where he grew up and studied the medical
            profession. He distinguished himself in this science and mastered all its import, being
            capable of maintaining existing health and restoring it when lost. I first met him in
            Damascus in Dhū al-Qaʿadah, 667/1258, finding him a man of firm character, resolute
            nature, manners sweeter than the breeze and words gentler than the air of paradise.</p>
          <p>He declaimed to me some of his poetry, excellent in meaning and sublime in purpose,
            containing different puns and precious parallels, eloquent phrases and truthful imports.
            As to medicine, he distingushed himself more than any of the ancients or his
            contemporaries, while <pb n="943" ed="kopf"/> in literature he was unrivaled by any poet
            or prose-writer. In addition to all this he was the leader of his generation and
            standard of his times in the science of religious law, according to the school of the
            Shafiʿite Imam. He had traveled from Danīsr to Egypt and then returned to Syria and
            settled in Damascus, where he served the families descending from al-Malik al-Nāsir
            Yūsuf in the fort of the city. He also frequented the Nurī Great Hospital in
            Damascus.</p>
          <p>The following are examples of his poetry, as he recited to me [mostly love poems
            addressed to boys] . . . .  </p>

          <p> The illustrious physician and unrivaled scholar, the leader of his generation and
            standard of his times, Abū Yūsuf Yaʿqub, was born and bred in Damascus. He
            distinguished himself in the science of medicine, but was also well-versed in all the
            philosophical sciences. His medical knowledge 
            <pb ed="mueller-1884" n="2.[272]"></pb> was perfect in both theory and practice,
            as he had mastered all its generalia and specialia; he was praised for his treatment and
            thanked for his conversation, which was noble among the notables and distinguished at
            all other times. He was a sound prop concerning the restoration and maintenance of
            health.</p>
          <p>A large group of physicians used to study under him and many students benefited from
            his knowledge. His writings have an eloquent turn of phrase and are truthful in meaning,

          <p> The illustrious physician and scholar Abū al-Faraj, the son of the peerless and
            learned Shaykh Muwaffaq al-Dīn Yaʿqūb b. Isḥaq b. al-Qaff, a Christian from Karak, was
            born in Karak on Saturday the 13th of Dhū al-Qaʿdah, 630/1232. His father, Muwaffaq
            al-Dīn, was a friend of mine, who kept our relationship intimate and strong throughout
            his life. Being with him was a sweet and precious experience and enjoying his friendship
            more joyful than the happiest wedding. He was the light of his generation and the most
            intelligent of his contemporaries. He was the best at memorizing poetry and an authority
            in history and biographies. He distinguished himself in the knowledge of Arabic and was
            outstanding in the literary arts, uniting in himself all the principles and different
            styles of writing and reaching the utmost in unusual meaning and excellent form. His
            well-proportioned handwriting was a pleasure to the eye, unmatched by any other copyist
            anywhere in the world.</p>
          <p>During the reign of al-Malik al-Nāsir Yūsuf b. Muḥammad he was a scribe in Sarkhad,
            working in the post office. His son Abū al-Faraj showed signs of intelligence from his
            youth, and these were indeed verified when he grew up. He was a good listener and a rare
            talker, <pb n="945" ed="kopf"/> had a broad mind and loved to hear the biographies of
            the learned. His father had the intention of teaching him medicine, and asked me to be
            his master. He attached himself to me until he memorized the first textbooks, such as
            Hunayn's "Problems," Hippocrates' "Aphorisms," the introduction to his study, etc. Abū
            al-Faraj came to know their import, understood the principles of their composition, and
            then continued to study under my guidance the ways of treatment contained in the books
            of Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. Zakarīyya al-Rāzī. Having studied them, he came to know the
            kinds of maladies and the major causes of diseases, mastered diagnostics and
            therapeutics and was familiar with different remedies. I taught him the principles and
            details of all these, their secrets and consequences.</p>
          <p>His father then moved to well-guarded Damascus, where he served in the supreme Divan.
            His son accompanied him there and studied, with a group of notables, the natural
            sciences and the philosophical arts under the master Shams al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Hamīd
            al-Khosrūshāhī and ʿIzz al-Dīn al-Ḥasan al-Ghanawī al-Darīr. He continued his medical
            studies with the physician Najm al-Dīn b. al-Mīnfāgh and Muwaffaq al-Dīn Yaʿqūb, the
            Samaritan. He also studied Euclid's book with the master Muʿayad al-Dīn al-Aradi,
            understanding it so perfectly that he solved all its difficulties.</p>
          <p>Abū al-Faraj b. al-Qaff served as physician in the fort of ʿAglūn, where he stayed for
            several years. He then returned to Damascus and served in its unconquerable fort,
            treating the sick there and being praised for his work and thanked for all his deeds.
